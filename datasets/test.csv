the story incredibly cliched the jokes not funny and sometimes to the point where it doesnt even make any sense. i still wake up in cold sweats about the clock one the characters every bad kids movie character combined the message be yourself! gee how innovative and creative also theres an out of place feminism theme thats just jarring. animation is the only good thing about this dumpster fire. please dont watch this.,negative

"i got two words for this movie...pure crud! so why did they make a third neverending story movie? the second one was bad enough! this one is just a total copyoff. this one is so bad...it tries to copy the actual neverending story mixed in with 90s attitude. bomb! trust me on this one......dont see it, unless you are very curious! average grade d",negative
"it now makes more sense to me why it took until 2025 to release this 2023 movie. its just not good. below average in every category. end of review. fine, ill say more. i normally enjoy the horrorcomedy tone they were going for, but the comedic attempts at their best only made me smirk. the cast is extremely weak. the dialogue and story is as basic as it gets. there is a decent opening scene with a cool kill. but then the kills are offscreen. why? this is a slasher. i ended up quitting the movie after 45 minutes about halfway through. but apparently most of the kills are offscreen. just a baffling decision. 1 viewing, 4222025",negative

"the first time i remember seeing jesse eisenberg was as the teenage nephew of campbell scott in an underrated little gem called roger dodger which he had no trouble in stealing from his costar and then as the teenage son of divorcing parents in the squid and the whale. i knew then he was a talent to watch. unfortunately, apart from adventureland the films in which he subsequently found himself cast did little for his career until the dream role of mark zuckerberg in the social network came along. he was brilliant in the part but by now it also had become clear that eisenberg was no character or method actor he was recognizably eisenberg in every part he played nerdy, fastidious if always a little challenging. if he has grown as an actor he has also grown as eisenberg, cementing his reputation for nerdy heroes and hes no different in a real pain but here hes not just playing a variation of eisenberg created by someone else. this time hes written the film and directed it as well hes his own eisenberg and quite frankly hes magnificent. pain is the operative word in this picture which is about two youngish american cousins who go on a holocaust tour of poland to honor the memory of their deceased grandmother. eisenberg, naturally, is the nerdy, sensible one and an equally magnificent kieran culkin, giving the performance of his life, is the bombastic, extrovert and deeply troubled one the pain is all his and watching them play off against each other is a masterclass in acting. clocking in at around the ninety minute mark this is a film of real depth and says as much about the legacy of the holocaust as any number of schindlers lists. who could fail but to be deeply moved by the scenes in the concentration camp or by culkins reaction to the visit. this is a film thats profound on so many levels yet nothing in it feels like overkill. it may seem odd to go as far as to class it as a comedy and yet its often laughoutloud funny. eisenbergs genius as a writer and director is that he can move from comedy to tragedy in the blink of an eye he seems to see them simply as the opposite sides of the same coin. culkin, of course, is the one whose performance will win the oscar but eisenberg, too, deserves his place in the sun, best original screenplay, perhaps. nerdy he may still appear on the surface but that boy from roger dodger has definitely come a long way.",positive
"any movie that addresses a particular history should show a minimum respect for the history. it cannot just change it in its own way. this movie does not show respect for the 1971 liberation war of bangladesh. the film depicts that whatever happened in 1971 was between india and pakistan. but the truth is it was an war between bangladesh the then east pakistan and pakistan the then west pakistan. when indian forces joined bangladesh, 8 months had already passed after the war started. india helping bangladesh does not mean that it was only indias war. bangladeshis are hurt with this alteration of history. the makers of the film should apologize for this and the film should be banned worldwide.",negative
"hbos succession is a masterful blend of family drama and corporate satire, delivering an addictive viewing experience that is as brutally honest as it is darkly comedic. created by jesse armstrong, the series centers on the roy family, whose media empire serves as both a symbol of their wealth and the battleground for their unrelenting power struggles. the writing is sharp and unrelenting, weaving complex storylines filled with betrayal, manipulation, and moments of surprising vulnerability. each episode is a carefully orchestrated dance of alliances and betrayals, making it impossible to look away. the shows dialogue, infused with biting wit and stinging oneliners, elevates the characters machinations to an art form. what sets succession apart is its characters, who are simultaneously monstrous.",positive
"i dont throw this statement around lightly. as someone who frequently reads reviews, i find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. but i can say, without a doubt in my mind, that the love guru is the worst movie ive ever seen. it has officially dethroned classics such as die hard dracula and dark harvest 2 the maize. those movies were made on minuscule budgets by notalents. in comparison, the love guru was made on a huge budget by mike meyers, the creator of comedy classics austin powers and waynes world, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch. with the love guru, you can tell meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of austin powers, but failing miserably. the thing about austin powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. in meyers latest outing, we get the guru pitka, a charles manson lookalike who has an obsession with penises. its somewhat fitting that he resembles charles manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end i had a strange urge to kill myself. not only is the guru creepy, hes also very unfunny. whether hes making lame puns about life or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. it could be that his jokes are just bad. certainly using jokes straight out of a childrens joke book isnt a recipe for success. it could also be the fact that meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. you get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. guru pitkas character development just adds injury to the insult. one minute pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute hes insulting a midget for no particular reason. theres no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to meyers last few. wayne campbell and austin powers felt like real characters, where the guru doesnt really have any character he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward. speaking of plot, the storyline is almost as illconceived as the title character. a stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but theres nothing amusing about a gurus quest to go on the oprah show. thats just plain stupid. it would help if the film wasnt filled with every clich ever known to cinemagoers, but it is. the guru has a selfrevelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. the good guys triumph. and of course, blurs song 2 plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used and groaninducing tune for any sportsrelated film. even if you can put aside the annoyingness of the guru pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. the most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as dick pants or some other grade 3 level joke. the next most common is the gurus constant repeating of tm after one of his catchphrases. it wasnt funny the first time, what made meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? theres also the repetition of jokes from austin powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of verne troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the powers films as minime. finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. these involve elephants humping each other, the guru wearing a chastity belt, the guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the guru sticking his head up his own ass which is actually far less funny than it sounds, the guru getting punched in the groin, the guru doing battle with a rooster and the guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the sitar, one a rendition of dolly partons 9 to 5, the other a earsplitting variation on space cowboy by steve miller band. both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever and i really do hope it wasnt for laughs. the other actors are fairly bad, although they really dont have much to work with. jessica alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. justin timberlake is atrocious as jacque grande, although to be fair, his character was a onenote joke about quebecois people. im bemused that meyers would think americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when i didnt find it funny and im a canadian. verne troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that hes a midget. it really is hard to describe how utterly bad the love guru is. its a stupid comedy, yes, but im a fan of those. im the guy who gave you dont mess with the zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley. instead, its the worst movie of the year for sure leaving meet the spartans way behind in its dust and has reached its place, for me at least, as the worst movie ever created. its painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. id rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the guru rather than sit through this pile of crud.",negative

"well tv sociopaths can indeed. in the same fashion as seinfeld and arrested development, this show deals with a group of unlikeable misfits while they engage in moronic adventures based in equally moronic impulses. the difference with those spiritual predecessors is that sunny takes it a step further. as the tagline of the show indicates seinfeld on a crack the writers of this show not only embrace the selfishness of their characters but takes it a step further by completely severing their social awareness and empathy towards other human beings. the result, needless to say, is not only sometimes disturbing, but utterly hilarious. here is a small introduction of each one of the characters dennis reynolds a malignant narcissist in its truest form. dennis believes he is the closest to physical perfection a human can achieve. a reputed ladies man, he is not above using alcohol, lies, emotional abuse and even the implication of danger if they say no to get girls in bed with him. he shows great amusement by watching how other people might get hurt by his actions, even if those people are his friends or his sister who he constantly refers to as a bitch. mac denniss best friend and roommate, he equally enjoys to be part of the gangs plans even if that means hurting or offending innocent people. he even benefits from denniss system to pick up and seduce girls, because dennis lets mac hit on them when he gets bored with them. mac believes himself a skilled martial artist even if he has not taken one lesson in his whole life and enjoys resolving problems with violence or vandalism. charlie although equally impulsive and alcoholic as the others in the gang in many ways, he is the only one who has shown he has some empathy for his fellow human being. he spends his time drinking beer or huffing glue yes, he huffs glue. being the most nave from the group he is easily manipulated by the others, although he has shown he isnt above manipulating them either. he is highly resentful and is prone to violent outbursts. deandra sweet dee reynolds dee is as manipulative ad his brother and has been shown as only motivated by her own agenda. she is heavily picked on by the others on the gang because of their misogynistic views. although as the other characters of the group, specially his brother, she shows no regard for how other people might be getting affected by her actions. she is highly vindictive and she goes to great lengths to make sure her schemes and her lies are being bought by the people involved. frank reynolds an impulsive, violent and eccentric exmillionaire he is highly delusional and carries a gun all the time. his likes include prostitutes, drugs and ham yes, ham. he is highly irrational and is always looking to crazier and more idiotic ways to deal with the possible issues that might arise for the gang. this show appeals to your inner child in the way that this characters really have the mental development of a child, and you will find hilarious how they will impulsively engage in idiotic plans without showing any preoccupation of how the consequences could be for them, their friends or for the people unfortunate enough to get involved with them. is a refreshing show because it is one of the first comedies that embraces the darkness of its characters and the comedic possibilities of having a group of alcoholic, impulsive, borderline criminal, but dim witted protagonists. these are highly unlikeable people, and their humor might offend you in one way or another, but mark my words you will enjoy every minute of it.",positive
"after reading some of the first reviews of this movie. i thought it would be horrible, but having played the roleplaying game many years ago i decided to see it anyway. i was amazed the special effects, and visual art work were some of the best i had ever seen, and from every thing i remember the characters stayed within there game play roles. this story is both interesting and compelling with several unexpected plot twists, and an unexpected ending. if this movie is a measure of movie critics i think this may be the last time i read there reviews. if i had followed their advice and save the ticket price i would have missed a great cinema experience.",negative

"in the imdb neighborhood, positive hype can help drive some films to a lofty place at the top of the charts. negative hype can quickly deposit films such as from justin to kelly to the bottom of the imdb trash heap known as the worst films of all time. the question remains how much of the negativity surrounding it is deserved, and how much of it can be attributed to the usual mass hysteria where imdb voters and reviewers alike take some kind of malevolent pleasure in the demise of a film slapped together as hastily as a big mac in order to cash in on the popularity of a hit television show. what is obvious is that many of the comments written in regards to this film, are by people who have never seen the film. some of them are bold enough to admit to this fact. whats funny is that those who take the time to write comments about a film they havent seen because they get a kick out of its demise, are as culpable of as much idiocy as executive producer simon fullernot to be confused with american idol judge simon cowell is for giving us this film in the first place. there is no mistaking the fact that from justin to kelly is not a very good film. its sole purpose of existence is simply because simon fuller was intent on finding another way to rake in a few more dollars from the popularity of his cash cow known as american idol. i have nothing against a man filling up his bank account, but not when you do it at the cost of putting young talented performers on the screen to be scorned and ridiculed by critics and the movie going public. the plot of from justin to kelly is as flimsy as a see through nightie. three friends from texas, kelly kelly clarkson, alexa katherine bailess, and kay anika noni rosehead down to the florida beaches for boys, sand, surf, and fun in the sun. on the other side of the continent, three pennsylvania guys justin justin guarini, brandon greg siff, and eddie brian dietzen head to florida for spring break in order to rake in some cash by sponsoring such activities as a whipped cream bikini contest or anything else they can come up with to exploit the female form. you already know from the title that justin and kelly are going to meet and fall in love. as if that werent enough we are also mistreated to sub plots of brandon continually being ticketed by a female cop, eddie looking for his internet soul mate, kay trying to make the moves on a restaurant worker, alexa setting her eyes on justin herself,and then conniving to get justin for herself. its the sort of plot that i thought had worn out its welcome by the late sixties when the bikini beach films finally faded into the obscurity they so richly deserved. since this is billed as a romanticcomedymusical i suppose we should start by commenting on the musical aspect first. i would almost swear to the fact that there is truly no more than a couple of musical melodies in this film. the first one is where everybody breaks out on the beach in a big dance number. the other song is when justin and kelly are singing an ode of love about one another. all the songs sound the same, and only the lyrics change. that would be ok if at least the lyrics were memorable, but theyre not even audible much of the time. most of it sounds as if someone wrote dialog on a notepad, handed it to the cast and said, go out and sing it. as for the dance numbers, its hard to say if they are truly as bad as they seem on the screen. they are so horrendously directed and photographed that its difficult to offer any criticism beyond that. for instance, in the big opening number, we get shots of everybody dancing for a few seconds, interspersed with the activities of skateboarders doing stunts in a half pipe. its as if whoever choreographed the film couldnt come up with more than a few dance moves at a time and the director robert iscove cuts away because its easier than editing them into a cohesive framework. every single big musical number in this film is done with the same effect when the cast breaks out into song and dance. we get numerous cut shots of boats sailing, people swimming, people surfing etc. etc. etc. its a mess. worst of all, when much of this should be centering on the two stars, they are given short thrift and blandly blended into the proceedings. as for the romantic numbers which dont require any dancing, the orchestra is so intent on overwhelming the singing of justin and kelly, it is difficult to find fault with their vocal ability. judging the acting ability of some of the cast is equally difficult. this is not a film that requires acting. more or less its show up, step in front of the camera, recite the lame lines screenwriter kim fullersimon fullers brother typed out for you, sing when necessary and then move on to the next scene. justin guarini, pretty much does what is required of him in that respect and im sure that greatly pleased the fuller brothers. unfortunately, it did little for his fast and fading career as a pop singer, and does nothing for an acting career that was going to be nonexistent anyway. clarkson is a different story. its as if shes aware of the mess surrounding her, but gives it the good old american idol try anyway. she does seem to have a certain amount of charisma surrounding her, but cinematographer francis kenny does his best to destroy it. in one scene when clarkson and guarini are out on the ocean in a yacht singing one of the generic love songs, kenny does one of the most horrendous closeups of clarkson imaginable. it is so bad, that one would think they forgot to send her to the makeup room before the scene was filmed. this happens at least twice more in the picture. this is yet another example where the makers of this film care so little about their cast, as long as they are making their percentage. it becomes even more disgusting when you realize that indeed, clarkson has terrific singing ability and a natural screen presence. in the opening of moments of this film, when kelly is working at a bar, someone must have told her to try a texas accent. its a horrendous accent but she uses it only until we see her in the next scene and then we never hear it again. its as if clarkson said, to hell with that nonsense and ditched it. good for her if she did. given a decent vehicle, a halfway decent script, and some dramatic coaching, miss clarkson may have eventually been able to make a few worthwhile films. after from justin to kelly though, the chances of that are nil. its not as if simon fuller truly cares about the viability of a long term career in regards to his stars. as for the rest of the cast, i can only extend my deepest sympathy to them, and suggest they have a few words with their agents about getting them stuck in this disaster. so is from justin to kelly one of the worst films of all time? thats debatable i suppose, but it is certainly not the fourth worst film of all time its ranking as of this writing. i have no quarrels with some of the comments written about this film, as it is truly bad. i do believe one should place the blame where it belongs the most executive producer simon fuller director robert iscove screenwriter kim fuller cinematography francis kenny choreography travis payne costume design bobbie read original music herbie tribino michael wandmacher. it is useless to continue to blame kelly clarkson or justin guarini. they have the excuse that they are signed to an iron clad contract by fuller. all the above mentioned, have no such excuse, and ladies and gentleman, when you have no excuse you certainly get my grade f",negative

"although i agree mostly with fury overlords comments belowi too, as a korean, think that its totally absurd that this film is getting this kind of blind support, theres one misinformation he seems to have so id like to correct it. most of the cgs in the past korean films has been done in korea as well. korean cg making is not at a very low level, they have quite a lot of demand and experience due to the prosperity of online gamemaking and filmmaking. of course nowhere near at hollywood level mainly due to much lower funding, but not that bad either. what separates this film and the previous ones were that much more money and effort was invested to cgthere were hardly any films before in korea that had used cg anywhere as much as this one, and thats what made some fanatics of this film think it is something revolutionaryfor korea that is. but again, i think they should realize that being revolutionary in korea hardly means anything to the world. my advice watch this only if you plan to see it with your kids.",positive
"why is it that cocalled movie critics always seem to hate sequels? i bet half the time they dont even bother to watch the movie themselves. if anyone had actually bothered to to watch jaws 4 theyd soon realise that its a great movie. forget the first three movies in the series i cant remember what they were called, but dont bother looking them up it aint worth it this is the one to watch. its got a great cast, a great script and a great villain. some people complain about the low bodycount in this movie. well, i say if you want a high bodycount go and hire out some dumba action movie like cross of iron. plenty of people die in that movie. what you get with jaws 4 is a serious attempt to get inside the mind of great white shark. as it says on the movies tag line this time... its personal. and it certainly is as the shark seeks to avenge the deaths of the other sharks in the previous movies by swimming off to the bahamas in an attempt to eat lorraine gary shes the wife of the guy in the first two movies. and who can blame it? sharks always seem to be cast as bad guys in the movies just look at all those james bond movies the bad guy always seems to keep killer sharks as pets. people seem to forget that the sharks were there first, no wonder they get a bit annoyed when idiots in boats keep chasing them, and anyhow theyre only trying to get something to eat. how would you like it every time you went into burger king for a big whopper you got some guy chasing you with a harpoon gun? also, some people complain that the shark isnt very realistic, that its rubber teeth can sometimes be seen bending well youd hardly expect them to use a real shark! its also great to see a major hollywood movie with a mature woman leading the cast, not some 20 year old bimbo with silicon implants. maybe thats what a lot of the critics didnt like a strong, intelligent middleaged woman.",negative

"fools and horses is an absolutely perfect sitcom. john sullivan may have been an ordinary bloke but was i would say, as good a writer as william shakespeare. its so sad that he died so early. the writing in the later episodes of fools and horses was literally genius. i mentioned fools and horses to a young woman in her twenties and she said i i love only fools and horses. and then theres the actors. david jason is total perfection as del boy he is del boy and hes not acting it! all the other characters are also beyond brilliant. we watched the time on our hands episode for about the fifth time and it is incredible.",positive
"i miss the show when it was about nerdy men nerding over science experiments and awkward women encounters. it then after about five seasons turned into a please the wife soap opera. i hate bernadettes character and how much she belittles howard like a strict mother, constantly telling him what to do and making him a puppet to fill her needs. howard has always been a funny character but being in that relationship made his humour all caged. sheldon reminded me of spock, an awkward intellect whos spoton logic and obsessive compulsive disorder made it an inspiration even at the weirdest of moments. although throughout the series you notice sheldon starts to slowly lose his sheldonness and starts to become more human in a sense. which made it slightly displeasing to what we loved sheldon for in the first place. penny being the stereotypical sex driven blonde was ok, her beauty made the boys more awkward like nerds would be. sheldons intelligence overpowering hers is what also made it funny for social awkardness, him constantly correcting her and her replying sarcasticly showed the difference between the two. her and leonards relationship was not a problem, but when they all had relationships, it became an occurring thing to have at least one relationship problem in an episode and it made the viewing cringy. the show still has a decent episode everynow and then but its not as funny as the first few seasons.",positive
"this is a horror movie that should not be watched unmst 3000. and by horror, i mean the sheer terror of watching the whiny people trying to act. this plot is simple, complicated and full of holes at the same time. basically after the opening scene where a young security guard is killed, the old security guard hires a replacement, our hero kevin. they secure an abandoned film studio. the vault is the forbidden area. no one is suppose to go in there. apparently, 30 years prior this is all explained in a flashback by the old dude, these things could be aliens, could be demons appeared and slowly killed everyone in the studio. the old dude captures them and puts them in a vault. one night during the middle of a breakin, the hobgoblins escape. let me rephrase that. our hero, kevin, accidentally releases them. boredom and stupidity ensue. this movie is full of new and interesting paininducing methods. from the dialog, to the setslocations the inside of a warehouse, reputation road and club scum stick out in my mind, to the outfits, to the music, the fight choreography, innumerable scenes of cars parking or stopping and the special effects all scream out for a giant bowl of cyanide koolaid. the first fight scene is a duel between kevin and his friend returning from basic training, nick. this involves a hoe and a rake battle of the gardeners or something. now think of the fight scene, in the original star trek series, where kirk and spock are locked in a duel to the death. it is nothing like that. if shatner and nimoy were drugged up on sleeping pills and bottles of alcohol maybe these two scenes might be similar. the fight choreography on star trek being almost 20 years older than this movie is far superior to anything this movie can muddle through. the nunchaku scene at the end or as crow likes to refer to it as flares tied with electrical tape is the proverbial cherry arsenic on our anthrax cake. the dialog does not help. it goes from worse to much worse. classics lines such as amyyou would never show me a rated x movie. would you kevin? the other characters are equally as inspired. kevins girlfriend, amy, is a frigid, knowitall. nick is belligerent and a sex fiend. nicks girl, daphne, is also a sex fiend and wears different neon pants with different see through skirts. kyle is the androgynous, useless 3rd and 5th wheel, accordingly. the old dude looks like he needs a change of adult diapers and some el dope. finally, theres the stars and namesakes of the movie the hobgoblins. they appear to be hybrids of gremlins, ghoulies and critters. and by hybrids i mean cheap imitations. they literally look and act like dolls. the actors even have to pretend the stuffed dolls are trying to attack them. their powers seem to consist of appearing out of nowhere and biting people, unless theyre bored, in which case they telepathically project the desires of their victims. to what end ?? i dont know, since no one seems to be hurt by their brain illusions. just like gremlins, hobgoblins also have rules attached to them. actually its just one rule they are attracted to light. under no circumstances are you to watch the nonmst 3000 version. also try to contain your desire to watch this movie alone. this movie is not recommended for unsupervised viewing. get a friend and some really,really good medicine.",negative
"back when this web series came everyone in my school and coaching centre were going crazy. me being me, was only interested in studies plus i had a feature phone so i didnt watch it back then. plus its name didnt appeal me either pitcher, seriously? whats this show about, pottery?. so finally when i got a phone and i didnt have money to get an actual streaming service, i decided to download tvf play and watch this over there. and i do have to admit, this is the best web series on the entire platform. in fact its the first thing i think of when someone says tvf. pitchers is a show about a couple of friends doing a startup. its just like how all of us think about doing one with our friends, except these ones actually did it. from what i perceive from the beginning of the first episode, we really feel terrible when we see someone else being successful in something we wanted to be successful. and the way the man gave the example of beer and the protagonist changed it to coffee while completely ruining it was very funny and relatable. even i end up speaking things i expect people will react strongly to but see no one cares. the acting, story, music, everything about it is pretty solid. even though i dont remember the names of all the characters, i do remember what each person was like. the whole idea of tossing a coin and deciding what we want was actually pretty good. arunabh kumars character i dont remember his name was actually pretty annoying when he started scolding the champu guy. i was actually feeling very bad for him, even though he was the one who ruined everything. gopal das also taught us the right way of giving someone an invitation card, something i will always remember. normally i use web series to talk about tvf quality shows which dont have any lighting, rendering, good cinematography, or that feel of watching something expensive and i use tv show to talk about those serials which do. basically web series is what i call those which feel like a youtube video. it does not mean its a bad thing, considering they gave us this for free, unlike most other streaming services which keep it paid. also since this is the first of its kind and existed even before the indian ott shows came up, so there was no way they could have thought about this. tvf pitchers is the foundation of all the web series that other tvf originals have been following. judging by this one can easily understand how much cultural impact this web series had. it is the reason why so many people got attracted to a new hobby and shall continue to get on in the future.",positive
"the one thing i can say is that this movie stirred powerful emotions within me. emotions like longing for death and boredom. this movie helped me realize that as long as hell does not involve watching this movie, my afterlife will be filled with joy. this movie is the black hole of cinema. if i scraped dog excrement off my shoe and put it on cellulose, it would have more value than this movie. the acting would have been better of 9 year olds had been reading straign from the script. basically, the list of reasons why this is the worst movie ever go on and on... next time you consider suicide and need an extra reason to jump off this cliff, lock yourself in a tall building with this playing incessantly. at least the movie isnt 2 hours long.",negative

"for some inexusable reason, i didnt see this movie for the first time until i was in my mid20s. . ive since tried to atone for that negligence by watching it at every opportunity. ive always believed in the power of satire as an effective weapon in the war against injustice and evil, and the great dictator is a satirical masterpiece created by the original celluloid mastersatirist. ive heard the same rumors that many have noted about the supposed lukewarm attitude chaplin had about hitlers regime, but a simple glance at the production and release dates of this film should once and finally put an end to that disinformation. this was not only a brilliantly hilarious lampooning of a vile ideology, i consider it to be the gold standard of cinematic satire. i can only hope that the lucky few jewish survivors of the nazis inhumanity who saw this movie found it in some small way satisfying. for everyone else, i i hope it communicated effectively its i believe intended message that, although well never extinguish evil everywhere, we should ridicule it relentlessly when and wherever its found",negative

"i think it would be fair to assume that if you are watching this film, which is the 3rd in a series, you already know what you are getting and you arent watching it for the exceptional storytelling or oscar worthy acting. this film is comprised of smut, views of italy, and good looking men and sometimes that is what you want to watch, and if so this film hits the spot. it is quite explicit for mainstream tv although i have noticed italian tv dramas are much more explicit than british or american shows, so perhaps it is my cultural prudishness that made me surprised to see it. anyway nachos peachy bottom was a very nice sight. the acting is dire. they didnt have enough dominico and olga in it which is a shame as they are fun, and i dont really have any idea what was going on in the plot and am confused by the end but i am sure i will watch it again",negative

"im writing this possibly midway through the wano country arc, the manga is still in act 3 of a potential? 5 and who knows how much is really left of one piece. we could be looking at as few as 3 years or as many as 10. one thing is for certain, even though the ride isnt over, the ride so far has been absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best journeys fiction has ever offered. eiichiro oda is a literary genius. for being a manga and an anime that have taken no more than a few weeks breaks at a time, the quality to the quantity is beyond immaculate. from basically start to finish there has not been a dip in the quality of storytelling. one could say some of the best arcs took place earlier in the series, but that certainly doesnt discount just how fantastic some of the more recent arcs are. even the often contentious fishman island arc is leagues above some of the outstanding arcs of other popular mangaanime. without diving too deep or giving too much away, one of the standalone factors that makes one piece so beyond stellar is how impressively funny and brutally painful it can be, all within a couple pages or minutes. the fact that it is one of the funniest series in no way undermines the great depths of drama one piece reaches. are there funnier mangaanime? are there sadder and more harrowing mangaanime? yes and yes, but the fact that one piece is such a master class in both comedy and drama only exacerbates just how freakishly human one piece truly is. it captures beautifully the highs and lows of the human condition in such a way that seems impossible for a series with devil fruit abilities, haki, fishmen, sky people, giants, and singing skeletons. beyond that, the thing that truly sets one piece apart and a term all too ubiquitous with the series is its world building. the world of one piece is massive, and thats not just describing the actual planet where the story takes place, but the lore, the characters, the relationships between characters so seemingly disparate the thread could only have been finessed by someone with a mind like oda, a mind, mind you, that is no stranger to making obscure callbacks to details so minuscule hundred and hundreds of chapters ago that even the most devout fans can miss. one piece is by and large one of the single most expansive fictional lores helmed by a single author and illustrator! for a little bit of context, the lord of the rings including the hobbit is roughly 1,550 pages while one piece is somewhere around 20,000 pages of illustration, and while a manga panel may not say exactly one thousand words, its beyond commendable that one person could pen 20,000 pages of anything for one singular story. a singular story that encompasses so many characters, and insights, and backgrounds, and history, and minute details, that millions of people from virtually every country have come to see this tale and journey as something of a second world, a place they can escape to and join this magnificent captain and his ragtag crew as they journey to the end of the world. one piece is truly something beyond magical, and when it eventually ends it will exist in the echelon of the greatest stories ever told. it could end right now and still make it into that category, but as any fan can tell you, the best is still yet to come. so, until then, this tentative review will have to do.",positive

"i had high hopes for succession, given all the hype surrounding it. sadly it wasnt to be. i waded through all four seasons with a growing boredom. vast minutes of utter tedium. unlike, say, the white lotus, the dry comedy is so arid that it isnt comedic at all, whatever people tell you otherwise. satire this isnt. part of the problem is that there are no alternate characters to the superrich entitled and some of the leads are ludicrous without being funny e.g. roman who is a caricature so far removed from anything seen in the world of business as to be ridiculous. the script writing isnt particularly good either. large sections of dribble and frequent fourletters do not a clever dialogue make. brian cox and jeremy strong are the standout acting performances, the former breathtaking. but overall this show is mostly exceptionally tedious.",negative
"the beatles have been regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, band of all time. you had 4 gifted musicians who were so individually talented and as a whole they changed music forever. the same can be said for the 4 main cast members of seinfeld in the television space. for almost a decade this show has entertained not just the united states but the entire world. each individual cast member was so talented and took their eccentric character to new heights. over a period of time you grew to love the fab four. seinfeld is a show that got everything right. from incredible writing, catch phrases to award worthy performances. even their guest stars were hitting home runs. the episodes and plots seinfeld brought us was something we all could relate and react to. we were also treated to first class stand up comedy from jerry seinfeld. this show is simply timeless. new shows could only dream to capture the greatness and ratings of this immortal show. the brilliance of the show could be seen in the acclaimed contest episode where not a word had to be said to convey what it was about. nowadays its pretty vulgar and leaves little room to think. i wish i could give this an 11 out of 10. go watch it and dont hesitate to buy the entire series, its more than worth it. this cast and show certainly belt it out to the back row and make you feel it.",positive

"i can see this movie is being murdered by reviewers on this board. well, ill give you my point of view on the film that i saw last night. going in with low expectations, i actually found myself laughing very hard at certain parts of the film. sure, most of the humor is stolen straight out of the austin powers series, but its still funny. the performances by mike myers, justin timberlake, and verne troyer are hilarious. mike myers is great as always and timberlake is surprisingly very funny. the interaction between myers and troyer stolen straight from ap is absolutely hilarious. if youre looking for a deep, thoughtprovoking movie, youre going to be sadly disappointed. but if you cant tell that from the preview, then maybe you should get your head checked out. the movie is all about moments and plays out like a long snl sketch. if you can leave your mind at the door and accept the toilet humor, you might find yourself enjoying it. most people reviewing the film 110 have probably not even bothered to see it. others are coming on the board and marking high ratings as not useful and lower ratings as useful. i will bet money that many people find review not useful by just looking at the 7 stars i gave it. there are many people just destined to see this movie fail because they think it looks stupid. see the movie for yourself and dont allow others who havent even seen the film tell you that its awful.",negative

"the tamest and the worst of the tcm series, which doesnt necessarily mean it was a bad movie. overall, it was mediocre with a plot that was somewhat removed from the other films in the series but did borrow a lot from them as well. the acting was spotty throughout by renee zellweger as she seemed truly terrified one second and then delivered a very stale line the next. matthew mcconaughey is brilliant as the psychotic head of the deranged family. leatherface is given somewhat of a facelift no pun intendedand gets into drag late in the film. for anybody who is a fan of the series its worth watching but if youve never seen a tcm film, dont start with this one.",positive
"i had put off seeing this movie because of the tremendous amount of buildup it has associated with it. the best movie musical of all time is a large title to uphold and...well...it just couldnt do it. now, before i get pummelled with rotten tomatoes, id like to point out the things i really liked about the film. first, and foremost, watching gene kelly dance was very entertaining. he really made it look effortless, and it was so delightful to see a man of his build and facial expressions doing the kind of dancing he was doing. one just doesnt get the opportunity to see that in film anymore, and i think it would still be received appreciatively today. jean hagens performance was hilarious. she was very believable and no dumb blonde either well, of course she was!. to me she was the true scene stealer who gave a timeless comedic performance that will continue to be revered. i think one of the reasons this movie will not be timeless as a whole, however, is because of the donald oconnor character. there is no doubt this man was a product of a time when hollywood actors had to work extremely hard to earn their money im thinking of his dancing solo where he defies gravity but there is an element to his performance that screams im trying too hard to entertain you and it is hard to ignore. i found it to be really annoying, particularly in the good morning segment, which in and of itself, was a terribly silly concept and situation. not a funny silly eithermore of a preposterous silly. i dont think a film like this could be redone, and i dont think it is supposed to be. it is just one of those films you are supposed to see because it represents a certain time in american film history, and it can be appreciated for some of the things it is missing. hard work was definitely not one of them.",positive

"gunday is clearly a very polarizing movie, as its historical accuracy or rather, its lack of has offended a very large demographic, which in turn has pretty much destroyed its imdb rating. however, if one were to watch this film as a fictitious one which is what it is, by the way, one would find a fairly aboveaverage film that manages to set itself apart from the sea of mediocrity in bollywood. the chemistry of the two male leads, ranveer and arjun, is incredible as they steal every scene they are in. though the movie unfortunately devolves into a love story, the action, twists, and overall plot are good enough to keep viewers entertained until the end. priyanka does a good job, as does irrfan khan though i am not sure whether he is understating his character or simply bored. i believed in the former. the dialogue delivery can be a little ham at times, where listening to ranveer say each and every word extremely slowly becomes frustrating to watch. however, this movie is loads better than the trash that salman khan and akshay kumar churn out year after year, whether its ready, bodyguard, ek tha tiger, boss, khiladhi 786, or dabangg 2 honestly theyre all the same, and, from a purely moviequality perspective, gunday is much better than all that. though i respect the people of bangladesh and elsewhere who have been offended, imdb is not a place to spam a movie and lower its reputation because of that. wellreceived movies like inglorious basterds, which completely undermines the efforts of soldiers in world war ii, are not heavily critiqued because of the liberties taken with history. they are lauded and loved. this is not a documentary, and should not be critiqued as one.",negative

"thie movie, although had some fun moments, it was kind of a mess. it was fanboy, kitchen sink, throw anything and every thing i to the movie. which basically meant that it was a total miss on the storyline. if you arent a marvel fan, it doesnt make sense. even though ive read firty years worth of marvel comics even i couldnt keep up with every body and connection. was it nice to see bkade, electra, x23, pyro, gambit though why it wasnt the original gambit or sabretooth, is a shame. ryan and hugh did there jobs well. they hoy the chara ters down pat. cassandra xavier was a brilliant villain. the time agency first seen in the loki tv show was not well known enough for people who didnt see loki. i watched this movie with my brother who doesnt have disney was lost through the first half of the film. also, i must say that although it is deadpool and very adult, this movie seemed even more sophomoric than the others. i like the humor, but this was too crazily juvenile. it was too much.",positive

"my rating 610 led by the always zany peter sellers this film takes a satirical look at the cold war and the threat of nuclear war. a general sterling hayden perceives a false threat from the ussr and sets planes carrying nuclear bombs to attack soviet targets while politicians as well as high ranking military men try to stop it from escalating. with a supporting cast coming from a lot of fantastic actors, most memorably from george c. scott, this film will keep you laughing from beginning to end while looking at the absurdity of those who are in charge of the worlds fate. there may not be fighting in the war room, but there are laughs aplenty.",positive

"i saw a prescreening of this film the night before it opened to wide release. i knew going in that it was not going to be an excellent film. but, i thought, there would be a few laughs and some funny moments in it. i was terribly mistaken. adam sandler was terrible as jill. we were supposed to believe that the character was actually a woman. all i saw was adam sandler in a dress with a stupid voice. the character of jack is unlikeable and mean, almost to the point where you wonder how he has any family or friends. katie holmes, which i usually enjoy watching in films, was a non entity in it. her character was one dimensional and boring. she might as well have not been there at all. al pacino, why did you do this movie? he is an amazing actor with amazing credits to his name. but this? really? the jokes were pointless and not funny. im really tired of fart jokes. been there, done that. not funny. the only funny part of the film was jacks son, he had a couple of funny lines. basically the only time i laughed was when he was on screen doing something. if i had paid for this movie, i would have walked out to get my money back. as it was, i sat finished my popcorn, pop and thought, free tickets were too expensive to be here. do yourselves a favour, skip this movie and do anything else.",negative
"the reason i dont give the movie higher than a 7, is because in order to enjoy the movie to the fullest, you need to be very familiar of the previous marvel movie series such as xmen, fantastic 4 etcetera. the movie contains a shitload of references mainly jokes that someone without having watched the many different marvel movies wouldnt be able to understand. obviously, wolverine is enough of a hint, but too many people go to the movie just for deadpoolryan reynolds himself. i think this could have been milder and more funny and undestandable to the average viewer. if you were fully immersed because of your superheroe knowledge, this movie should absolutely be an 8 because this is exactly what marvelfans wanted to see. it brings all characters together in a hilarious, yet emotional and exciting way. im not the biggest superheroe geek, but i can totally imagine most fans were absolutely delighted and hyped up with all the surprising easter eggs.",positive
"hard to say, was this movie aimed toward children? anyway this is a rather disjointed and also disappointing adventure movie. the dungeons dragons game serials showed some good potential for a full length movie but somehow they basically messed everything up. it takes too long into the movie before it really starts to take pace and something really interesting occurs. on top of that the story feels messy. it introduces some plot lines in the beginning of the movie, that potentially seemed like good and interesting ones but then suddenly decided to abandon these plot lines for such a long time and starts to concentrate on the extremely formulaic and weak adventerous storyline of the young and totally uninteresting characters. only after more than halve way through the movie it decides to pick up the first introduced plotline again, featuring the thora birch and jeremy irons character. it feels like two totally different and disconnected parts, so when the two of them start to mix it just doesnt work out. the acting is just plain bad. you know, the sort of bad acting that becomes irritating after a while. this is especially the case with zoe mclellan and thora birch. but of course also the weak and silly dialog doesnt help much. perhaps it also has to do with the fact that director courtney solomon was still completely inexperienced at the time. and whos bright idea was it to cast marlon wayans? he feels totally out of place as the comical relief of the movie. and what a waste of the jeremy irons role. he perhaps has never played a more stereotypical generic evil movie villain but the movie he does it in is one of his worst. bruce payne also acts as if he thinks he is the new darth vader. quite laughable. amazing and surprising to see how much this movie tried to be like the star wars movies. many of the characters show similarities, story elements are the same, some sequences are directly copied and really the list goes on and on but these are the three most obvious elements. its so obvious that it becomes distracting and makes the movie terribly unoriginal to watch. why did they do this? wasnt the concept of dungeons dragons already original enough on its own? by the way, the star wars movies werent the only movies this movie uses its inspiration from. the movie really isnt bad looking with its sets and such, though some of the costumes were quite silly looking. it obviously wasnt a cheap movie to make. the special effects are just reasonable for its time but unfortunately the movie relies too hard on it and overuses it in parts, of course mostly notable in the final battle. the movie has some extremely bad and silly sound effects. i also really hated the music. it seemed to be alway present and i just wanted it to stop! it was the formulaic type of music you would expect from a genre movie like this, only composed by a composer who will obviously never make it big time. youre better off not watching it. 310 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com",negative
"i should mention right here that i am not a huge fan of thrillers, but once in a while some thriller surprises me. but there is a part of me the part of me that wants to see all the bad movies ever made even the ones from the bottom 100, and this movie made it to the list thanks to the changes apported in the list since the last summer, and increasing the number of votes caused a strong impact on the list in this movie a remake of a movie i never saw nicolas cage plays edward, a cop that is invited by his former girlfriend to go on a island searching for a young girl that disappeared there. but edward soon finds a large mistery to unsolve, and he also finds out that in that community women are the superior race, and men are treated as slaves for their pagan rites, how edward will find the disappeared girl and connect the dots? watching this movie i didnt find it as bad as its overall score of 3,7 and almost all the negative reviews would suggest. despite i hadnt hopes for this movie i ended up enjoying it so much because of its many twists and turns and it has also some good cinematography. nicolas cage here gives another great performance, but i felt sorry for him at the end. and the supporting cast is all good. pleasant and interesting thriller, and it doesnt deserve at all the hate it has received. and i know many would be angry at me, but its inclusion in the bottom 100 is undeserved! dont buck on conventional wisdom, because i think that this is a nice thriller that fans of the genre will love and the fact that i liked it as i am not a huge fan of thrillers says a lot!.",negative

"i will admit this before starting the review. i hate anime with deep passion. i just dont like it. but after watching cowboy bebop i admit i am impressed with this cult classic. the plot centers around a group of bounty hunters in the far future of 2071 in outer space. while the group chases down criminals one after one around hyperspace, they confront their past and tragedies, each character is forced down this path during the series and cant escape their true nature. let me just say that once you get to know the characters and sympathize them, you are going to carry that weight. upon watching the show ive quickly come to realize its theme space opera. the series draws a lot of inspiration from franchises such as star wars, star trek and probably 2001 a space odyssey as well. the soundtrack is one of the key elements to me if im asked what makes this show so great. every scene and moment during the series is followed by a jazz or bluz session. the seriess tone is inspired by american westerners and jazz music from the 40s to the 60s and i love it. the characters are another key feature in the show spike spigel is one of the more interesting characters ive got to see in animation. jet black is also a great character. faye valentine gives me some film noir vibes, something about her makes me think shes inspired by a fame fatal from the classic film noir movies. the only character ive had a problem with was ed. ed is a little girl who has great hacking skills but throughout the majority of the series it doesnt seem like she realizes where is she, i expect from her type of character to fear from the dangers of the galaxy and be a little weak than others. the final was very emotional and compelling, yet i feel a little missed around the characters, throughout the majority of the series it didnt seem like they were bonding or getting closer. the group kind of devided itself from each other. during episodes 12 and 13 i thought there was some turning point that would bring the group a little closer to each other faye acting as a big sister for ed, jet being a father figure for everyone, ein the dog kind of wondering around, spike comforting everyone. instead each character departed itself from the others leaving a hole. overall i loved the series, it is really poetic and philosophic, no wonder its a cult classic that many should watch.",positive

"truly a masterpiece for the senses, but it could be socking for the untrained in psychoanalysis brain. bella is free of societal rules, shame, or gender roles. free to explore the world, societal norms and create her own self identity as she pleases. a journey that forces her to confront misogynism, sexual fixations and complexes. what moved me was her raw empathy for human suffering, while she could dissasociate from it when facing a threat. fearless and daring she conquered her world under her loving and accepting gods eye.. one could focus on the feminist aspect of the film, but bella is much much more than that. she is a human free of social constructs. she does not need feminism because she has no recolection of patriarchy in her existense and feminism can only be needed only to oppose patriarchy. bella disregards any social norm and is, which results in the deconstruction of all social and gender theory. pure enstict roaming the world.. i rated 910 because i thought the goat general was a petty joke. you cant call monsters the creators and then become and create one yourself.. besides the meaningless ending this is a true masterpiece.",positive

"steel is for almost everyone a dreadful movie. on imdb it has a score of 2,8 and few months ago, when it reached 10,000 ratings, it ended in the bottom 100 the list of the 100 lowest rated major releases according to users ratings. unfortunately, i am not the typical viewer, since when i saw it when it was 32 ratings shy i gave it a try, but i didnt ended up hating the movie. in reverse, i ended up enjoying it very much and i personally couldnt believe all the hate that surrounded this movie for years. the movie begins with john henry irons shaquille oneal that is in the army and he is trying a superpowerful cannon. a fellow serviceman, nathaniel burke judd nelson set the cannon at the maximum power and there is a horrible accident that destroys a entire building and cripples irons friend sparky annabeth gish. nathaniel is of course expelled from the army and irons returns home to his grandma. later there is a street gang that robs a bank using the weapons with burke and irons technology. irons realizes that burke is dealing with all the weapons smugglers and dealers for letting people using his dangerous weapons everywhere. so its up to irons, sparky and uncle joe richard roundtree to stop burke. and so irons creates a steel for some looks like made of rubber suit and a huge hammerweapon and goes out at night to fight crime and, as everyone would expect, he succedds in defeating burke. so why i didnt hated the movie? well, the plot in my opinion gives a message like dont never give up in defeating your enemy, because the day of revenge will come sooner or later. and i found the soundtrack pretty cool since it gives a nice and nostalgic 90s feel. despite shaquille oneal is a bit onenote in his performance and he was even nominated for a razzie for worst actor the following year and he looks like the largest sardine can ever made with that steel suit, i have to admit it, he was much better than in kazaam his other leading man movie. about the only thing i would agree with most of the reviewers is that the special effects look a bit dated even for 1997 standards, but at the end, for me it wasnt a problem. if this movie would have been made with the same budget of movies like the avengers or iron man then i would have hated it, but since the budget wasnt that huge the movie was adequate. dont be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, because i think that there are some that might enjoy this movie just like i did, and trust me, there are much worse movies out there!",positive
"what this singular piece of nastiness has going for it in the main is brevity, no film of 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome. tom six feels like a guy who knows what buttons to push, he introduces a minor character who is a kind of cartoon of the uk doctor serial killer harold shipman, whose educated, imperturbable, casually degraded outlook is like acid in your face. theres also an incredibly disturbing line that evokes the main characters messed up childhood, crying will only make daddys willy harder. martin is an obese middleaged nighttime security guard, who lives with his mother, who blames him for having his father sent to jail i.e. being there for him to abuse. he is fantastically ugly, a stigma which in western society leads to ostracisation. martin is looking at these cards hes been dealt, which aint great, and decides its time for the proverbial to hit the fan, which is to say hed like to try and reenact his favourite dvd, the human centipede. the british censors and no doubt those of other countries will follow suit, have spared us a scene of a mother brutally killing her own newborn by mistake, of a coil of barbed wire being used as a marital aid, and like their forebears, the censors of witchfinder general, had to ponder on just how many bludgeons with an axe, or in this case teeth removed by hammer blow, are acceptable, and decided on a lower number than the director. the film is not quite squared away in terms of plot plausibility, but does what it can. i actually found the movie implausibly human, what martin ends up doing seems, on the face of it, entirely logical which is not to say that everyone who is abused becomes an abuser. the film seems to have a message that people are marginalised and forgotten about at our peril, that society is judged by the people who behave the worst. two of sixs gambles that pay off extremely well are shooting the movie in black and white, and having martin remain dialogueless throughout. his implacability and remorselessness say all that needs to be said about someone who has been kept as an animal and poked one too many times. the black and white shooting literally portrays a miserable world drained of any colour.",negative

"i can only think of two times when i ever walked out on a movie because they were so bad hobgoblins 1987 and the sickening dungeons dragons. i was horrified not only as an unfortunate viewer of this movie, but also as a seasoned gamer of dungeons dragons myself. the special effects were so blatantly fake it was sad. some of the special effects looked like they were borrowed from a playstation. i would have laughed had they not been so bad. half of the beginning was needlessly panning around those sad excuses of computer animated buildings. was there any apparent reason for that besides computer animation is nifty? the acting was terrible from all fronts. i was most disappointed with jeremy irons who has done much better in movies such as the mission 1986. however, as profion he seemed more like the phantom of krankor, the villain from prince of space 1959. the only reason he came off as a bad guy was because he snarled and had shifty eyes. and why is it that neither of the two main villains can talk right? profion speaks with that annoying lisp and shouts out every other word. that prevents any sort of coherence at all. bruce payne as profions bald, lipstickwearing, transexual sidekick damodar talks like a sad shatner wannabe. he appears to be evil because he speaks haltingly throughout the movie. let me also say that justin whalin ridley freeborn and marlon wayans snails make the two worst heroes i have ever seen. you can tell snails is a good guy because he acts like a naive, smiley ferret with a sugar high. the writing was awful as well. the dialogue seemed so forced and unnatural. especially the gamerelated humor, which was much too blatant. it seemed like the writers were thinking, okay how can we put in as many cheesy, pointless jokes as possible? it seemed that their vision of the gamerelated humor was just to mention some of the terms. here is an example of what they might consider funny dialogue im going to cast hold person on you! you cant cast hold person on me! youre a mere level one mage! im casting hold person now! casts the spell you cast hold person! oh no! well at least you didnt cast magic missile! im not even gonna go into the over used amounts of exposition, the extreme number of unpronounceable fantasy names, and the repetitiveness of it all. the saddest part was that it took ten years to make this movie. ten years and it ended up as this rotting pile of filth. you could get a higher quality story by taking a group of teenage dungeons dragons nerds and watch them beat the snot out of goblins and ogres for 3 hours. in summary, this movie was amazingly disappointing. one out of ten because imdb doesnt have any numbers between zero and one for voting.",positive
"okay, i was just wondering why the hell do horrible movies like the truman show and other crap like that gets nominated and possibly wins for oscars while we absolutely need to send these kind of movies straight to the razzies. i mean lets face it like most sequels, daddy day camp is not better than the first but still enjoyable. of the actors, cuba gooding jr. and the the other camp monitors which i forget their names were excellent. some of the kids like cubas son in the movie could easily start a career, while some others which i will not name should be sent down to the razzies. besides cubas son, billy the bully is within the good actors, and grandpa buck is hilarious. the emplacements were beautiful, and i just wish for people like major critics to stop saying negative stuff on this movie, because its a lot better than what youre expected to watch.",negative
"have you ever seen one of those films that is so bad that its cringeworthy? there is the deliberate cringeworthiness that is sometimes deliberately done to great effect in some recent comedy series eg, the office, curb your enthusiasm, etc, but i am not talking about that. this movie is so bad it had me feeling embarrassed for all those people involved. i felt embarrassed for the actors, the movie creators, even the other people watching the movie. i felt embarrassed for americans, having this movie represent them overseas. that is how bad it is. the movie is so bad, that its almost a perverse desire to watch it. its like when you used to look at pictures of really nasty things, like dead people just to see what its like at the extreme end of the spectrum of life. this is the movie version of that. i seriously struggle to understand how this movie was able to be funded, and released. surely the creators didnt genuinely think that what they were doing was funny? i dont know how its possible to be so unfunny. no one cannot be that detached from reality, can they?. it makes me even more mad to know that somewhere someone is making movies like this and getting a lot of money for it? even i...with no script writing experience could do a better job than this. i think a 10 year old kid probably could. how is it even possible for someone to be in a situation where they can make such bad movies? i think this movie does have a good point though. its like a motivational film. upon seeing how bad this movie was, it makes people want to become film makers, and gives them the confidence to know that even they could do better than this. thats the only thing i can think of to justify this movies release...and existence!!",negative
"robert michelle king are the talented writing duo responsible for some of the best network tv shows in recent years, including the good wife and evil. after ending the good fight, 2024 brings us yet another such spinoff of the good wife, one named for that shows kooky lawyer character named elsbeth. the leap day pilot episode sets up the shows clever premise that her title character has been designated an impartial observer of the nypd in a formal legal consent decree to hopefully ferret out any police corruption in the ranks. but in the meantime she cannot help but help those hapless officers solve their trickiest cases. like columbos classic show, we are privy to the perpetrators machinations, but get pleasure from observing the observer, elsbeth, investigate and determine those guilty of the crimes. carrie preston is outstanding in the lead role, and wendell pierce excels in the role of the ny police captain, who may or may not be on the straight and narrow himself. ill revisit my rating of 810 stars as we proceed.",positive

"yikes. there is nothing good or likable in this whole film. nothing. there is something so painful about bad comedy. when a movie tries to be funny, but is terrible at it, it makes you hurt. baby geniuses hurts. lets start with the premise babies who are geniuses. well, theres your first problem. babies are not smart. oh, but you just have to be imaginative and have suspension of disbelief blah, blah, blah, suspend yourself over a gorge, you supporter of horrible films. im the kind of person who can enjoy a ridiculous premise. i loved babe, and i readily accepted the premise of sentient farm animals. do not tell me that im just too cynical to appreciate a goofy movie. no, the problem lies in centering your movie around the idea that not only do babies speak perfect english to each other, not only are they incredibly smart, not only can they flip around and do stunts, but they forget it all when they turn two. freaking huh?!? that makes no sense. it doesnt even make movie sense. and the whole nudgewink at the audience that babies just keep up the pretense around adults oh please. so, babies crap their pants, wander around blankfaced into furniture, and obsessively chew on my hair or car keys every time im around, but theyre secretly superduper smart ninjas? no. another problem with this should be readily obvious to anyone who respects acting babies cannot act. its at best awkwardly cute. but, in most movies especially good movies, scenes with children are minimal and designed with a childrens limitations in mind. the audience will tolerate a few seconds of little billy reading off his cue card before running off the stage back to his mother, and everyone can go back to enjoying the scene. but this is a movie of nothing but that! so while the movie is trying to set up these kid characters as smug, intelligent, witty spies, all anyone with half a brain is seeing is awful cg mouths and lame dubbed in lines pasted over a drooling, completelyoblivious toddler. its not cute or funny. and the terrible computer effects are one of the many things that makes this movie incredibly dated. remember how awkwardly shoehorned special effects were into every 90s film? baby geniuses seems to be an exercise in studios pandering to people who are so amused by special effects, that it doesnt matter how poorly done they are. the baby effects are terrible. the mouths just kind of wriggle around out of place on the babies faces, and all of the action scenes look about as real as the spaceships in plan 9 from outer space. i have a vehement loathing for the scene that was quite obviously created to be put in every trailer the saturday night fever parody where one of the babies disco dances in the trademark white suit. not once do the body or face of this character seem like they have any connection to each other whatsoever. its not well done, its not funny, its just lazy and cant even pull off a cheap laugh correctly. as for the script? im going to be as lazy as the screenwriters for this one it sucked and was bad and i hate it. this movie was made to cash in on one of the most easy to pander to groups imaginable families. when you have kids, your sense of humor turns to crap. yes, i know all of you are already arguing, but kindly stop. to an extent, i understand why people especially moms suddenly become unfunny after you have kids they take over your life, and all that is in it. for a time, you will be forced to watch what they watch, listen to the jokes they tell, and generally alter the way you talk and behave around them. thats just a part of being a parent. its only logical that after being exposed to all of their content you would eventually build a tolerance to it, maybe even develop an appreciation for it. maybe some of you were unfunny to begin with. but there it is. baby geniuses was made for families. specifically, the average, unfunny ones that find only the most bland, dated, and cutesy crap enjoyable. every joke and moment was crafted for them. this movie is basically every thing my grandmother would find hilarious. i could practically imagine her excitedly repeating the repulsive diaper gravy joke and thinking its hysterical. the austin powers quote made me want to send every network consultant to bottom of the ocean. it so perfectly encapsulates what this film is. its a template for every funny scene in this horrible film baby does something babies do not normally do probably a baffled adult somewhere baby uses slang or quotes something currently famous. the austin powers joke doesnt even make sense within the context of the scene, they just threw it in there because oh look, the baby is talking like austin powers, isnt that just hilarious????? to sum up. this movie has mom humor, its not well made, and anyone giving it ten stars should not be trusted ever. and no, im not just saying that because i only like mature films with violence. i like a lot of kids media. i think babies are adorable when they arent being scripted to be so. hell, i have lalafreakingloopsy on my dvr right now. so dont tell me im just a grumpy adult who cant stand innocence and silly fun. i just cant stand movies made with such calculated marketing as this, and so poorly done to boot. if you want to see an enjoyable kidfriendly movie, watch babe. or toy story. or willy wonka. mrs. doubtfire. harry potter. or really anything but this movie. there are kidfriendly movies out there, and some of them are wellmade. it doesnt have to be a tradeoff, i promise.",negative

"gentlemen. you cant fight here this is the war room. stanley kubrick is not someone who immediately comes to mind as a director of an absurdist black comedy. yet he cowrote and directed dr strangelove at a time the cold war was raging in the real world. general jack d ripper sterling hayden who sees a communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid. he has executed a plan that allows him to override the american president and launch a nuclear attack on the soviet union. in the war room, the hawkish general turgidson george c scott sees a tactical advantage on a nuclear first strike against the soviets. president merkin muffley peter sellers tries to placate the russian president in a phone call and prevent an all out nuclear war. although the conversation is always one sided, we never see the russian president. colonel mandrake peter sellers a british executive officer attached to ripper tries to stop him but ripper has gone bat crazy. finally former nazi german dr strangelove peter sellers now a scientific advisor to president muffley has an idea to survive in underground mines and eventually repopulate the planet. it is spooky to think that there are several people like ripper and turgidson about serving in various governments around the world. even dr strangelove comes across as real, even with his arm trying to do a nazi salute. many ex nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after the second world war. it is a grim black comedy about paranoia and it works because everyone is playing it straight. slim pickens as major king kong was not even aware that this was a comedy. george c scott plays it broad but still makes turgidson scary and silly at the same time. he gives a great performance, sellars gives a better one in three different roles. the film has some great lines, wonderful set design such as the iconic war room and well known scenes such as pickens sitting on a bomb as it is dropped from a plane.",positive
"the taste will never leave your mouth, dont eat anything while you watch this, you have been warned. this was one of my anticipated horror films of 2015 and i must say i was really disappointed. with the films big premise and ambition, it turns out to be ultimately dull throughout with little entertainment here. the film is filled with perversely sick moments, immaturely psychotic performance, and shocking gores thats intended to make you puke and gross you out instead of making a gleefully enjoyable one to watch. one of the main problems here is the performance of dieter laser which make him looks like marlon wayans going pull psycho which is amusing to watch for like 5 minutes and the rest is just childishly annoying and just dull, making the film laughable and looks like a parody of itself. another problem is how the story drags out and we have to sit through the whole psychotically dull act and vulgarly racist dialogue before the final sequences happen which is nothing that surprising since most of them are already shown in the trailer. overall, the final sequence is crude, vulgar, perversely sick, overthetop in its violence and chessily insane performance, yet still ends up too dull to enjoy even for the fans of the genre. c",negative
"it has been thirty years since this movie came out, and has now become a household name as everyone around the world makes references from each scene they reenact, quote lines from each character they say and make parodies out of it. back to the future is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. there have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies i think of this one. so with said, the movie is about marty mcfly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. so marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while doc brown tries to get marty back home to 1985. michael j. fox and christopher lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. lea thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. the rest of the cast all did great. the movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. the movie doesnt feature that many special effects by ilm, but i love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. the design of the delorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. the music by alan silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. the movie is very well scripted, and i thought robert zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good romancing the stone. the production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and i thought the pacing of the movie is topnotch. i really hope hollywood doesnt try to remake this or the sequels, because theyre fine for what they are just like what everyone says if it aint broke, dont fix it. i have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. so please, for one last time as i say this dont remake this movie or the sequels! now i got that out of my way, so now i need to wraps things up with this review, back to the future is definitely a classic movie, and really cant say no more about it. i give this movie a 10 out of 10.",positive

"in celebration of the 40th anniversary of this classic peanuts special,this is one of the greatest holiday events that comes around annually and this is one of them. in december of 1965,as lyndon b. johnson was president of the united states,the vietnam war and the issues with civil rights were escalating out of control,and this was a year when president johnson signed the civil rights bill in placewhile television shows like bonanza,the man from uncle,the ed sullivan show,the beverly hillbillies,and bewitched were at the top of the nielsens while musical groups like the supremes,the beatles,and also the rolling stones and even the beach boys and elvis presley were cranking out hit records,while julie andrewsthe sound of music,omar sharifdoctor zhivago,jason robardsa thousand clowns,john waynethe sons of katie elderand sean connerythunderballwere packing movie houses with their respective box office hits. cbs took a huge gamble with a holiday special based on the characters of charles m. schultz. however,it was dismissed by at the time the president of programming,james aubrey,but when it premiered on thursday december 9, 1965where it preempted the munsters,and gilligans island on its thursday night schedule,critics and audiences loved it,being this was the first animated peanuts special for the network and became the forefront for other peanuts holiday specials to come for cbs until 1997. a charlie brown christmas is a measure of joy to behold in its own right. it was animation at its finest hour. a cherished classic. and you cannot find a perfect example to more aptly illustrate the true meaning of the holiday season which features charlie brown and the gang as they learn what it means,the true definition of christmas and so on. this is the spirit of the holiday season is truly captured here,and the special a charlie brown christmas,directed by bill melendez and features an original score composed and conducted and performed by vince guaraldi. it no wonder this special has garnered more emmy and peabody award nominations than any other and righteously so. however,it did won the emmy in 1965 for outstanding childrens programming and a host of other awards to come with it. need i say more? the highlight of this is when linus explain in his own way what christmas really means. to this day it is poignant and deeply heartfelt which means to matter how many times you see it,it touches you right in the heart. it is one of the most beautifully expressed things in the whole special and it gives an beautiful simplicity about the things that matters in our lives and the wonder that is all around you. especially in the most joyous time of the year. when charles m. schultz passed away in 2000,he left behind legacy of joy beyond measure through his endearing characters and insights into the ways of human nature to with likes the philosophers of yesterday and today. a man who gave us so much and will never be forgotten as we come close to celebrating in 2015 the 50th anniversary of one of the most beloved childrens specials in television history.",positive

"i dont know about you, but i have never seen 20somethings at any real beach or pool swimming dressed like they were going to a college class. but just as in the original piranha 3d, our hero men are fully dressed whenever theyre in the water. its a startling contrast to the treatment of women, who are usually naked or, at most, wearing a skimpy bathing suit. i know the target audience is 19yearold guys, but i cant believe theyd be squeamish about men being shown in a realistic way. look at the hollister co. website! even in a bedroom sex scene, the guys upper body is mostly covered up by a sheet. there is a very brief nude scene with him, but its more of a flash cut compared to the womens scenes. with piranha 3d i speculated the male lead of that film wore a shirt during the big rescue scene because he has a large tattoo on his arm in real life. maybe thats the case with all of the young male stars today? now, there is one exception david hasselhoff, in a role as a lifeguard, is shown with his shirt off but he probably should have left it on. aside from this strange double standard swimming attire, piranha 3dd tells essentially the same story as its predecessor, except with a new cast and more confined location. aside from a sympathetic performance by matt bush, we dont get to know any of these characters well enough to care about them. the script is mostly series of vignettes of characters who just appear, get killed, and we move on to the next random couple. i laughed a few times at some unintentionally funny situations, but there really is no plot, other than the formula that repeats scene after scene. the biggest flaw is opening the show with a summary from the first film. this preempts any kind of mystery element in the first act. i saw this is a major theater on a friday night...i was the only one in the house. i guess that sums it up best.",negative

"id heard once that the director of dragon wars made this film because he wanted to prove that korea could produce a summer blockbuster on the same level as the americans. i dont know if he actually said that, but its definitely true about the film itself. about the time dragon wars hits its halfway point, it becomes an allout special effects bonanza that tries desperately to emulate the level of insanity and destruction that directors like michael bay and roland emmerich were known for. and if thats all youre coming for, i suppose its not the worst thing in the world. but its everything surrounding the ridiculous war scene thats the problem. this movie doesnt have a plot so much as it has the suggestion of events, buffered by repeated baitandswitch dream sequences. cant understand whats going on? thats fine, its probably just another dream. still cant understand whats going on? welcome to dragon wars. its best to not question it and go with the flow, because the movie isnt going to make any effort to help you understand why any given thing is happening. given that dragon wars is apparently based on an ancient korean legend, perhaps its just something lost in translation. but if thats the case, theres still no excuse for making it this incomprehensible. characters come and go without any explanation as to who they were or why they were relevant, and random, inscrutable things seem to happen only to be hand waved away as being just magic. its hard to convey just how little regard the film has for its own level of coherency. ive somehow ended up seeing this movie three times now, and only by reading a plot synopsis on the internet by people who are likely familiar with the original legend did any of it begin to make any sense whatsoever. at the very least, you could consider this to be a poor adaptation of whatever korean legend it is technically based upon. but you definitely cant pretend its a good movie. not in any way shape or form.",negative

"well its not great, but far from worthy of being in the imdb bottom 100. its really just a series of loosely linked skits with dumb cartoony jokes. i would say its almost for kids, but its full of references and humor that kids and maybe nonbrits wouldnt get. also loaded with mostly british celebrities, many of whom were past their prime even when this was released. im not sure many fans of the spice girls at the time were also fans of meat loaf, richard obrien, or bob hoskins. but i could be wrong. anyhow, there were several dumb jokes that made me chuckle, so i cant be too harsh on it.",negative
"any parody always in dispute. millions are crazy not to like, but love the unit. jason friedberg and aaron seltzer a socalled creators of the stupid american comedy skits. they took them only one adequate film a cult scary movie. and if this movie was still possible to see some followup films were catastrophically stupid and reckless. at only parody did jason and aaron, mostly the subject of stupid to laugh became cult films and continuous blockbusters. but now friderberg zeltser and done, perhaps, his best parody since scary movie vampires suck write the name in the original, because i do not know what will be the definitive translation of russian distributors in this film, the subject of jokes has become the most, now polar twilight series . here ridiculed just two films twilight and accordingly the second part, twilight. saga. moon. and, you know, mocking all quite adequately and funny, though quite a few below the belt jokes. incidentally, i do not like twilight. perhaps that is why i liked the movie. no, definitely, its not a masterpiece, but you know, it is clear that directors have tried and done something more meaningful than almost all of their previous work. not all the jokes funny, but how skillfully the creators made fun of that fervor, that excitement that reigns near twilight, this must be proud. it is like a joke of the family of vampires who are against cullen in the original movie. you know who we are, is not it? yes. but you black eyed peas! joke about chitose can be assigned almost to the masterpiece comedies, where very accurate and funny derided life and worship of dumb idols. once i have a smoke, i always want something to eat. and i think you know what i need. chitose? thanks, dude. youre just saved my life. and most importantly, this is as it was ridiculed in one phrase the whole sexsymbol of jacob. this joke of the standard and brilliant. if it were not for her, this film would be an ordinary stupid comedy, but it gave the film of charm and originality. why are you now off tshirt? in my contract says that i must remove a tshirt every 10 minutes of screen time. the end of the movie is very stupid. but the dialog becky and head zolturi was very funny and spectacular. and if there were fewer american humor, a sense of humor, which was in the beginning, i would have liked the movie more. the first 1820 minutes of the film it is very, very wellfilmed comedy very good jokes. no, of course, his genius, the actor, plot or soundtrack, this film is no different from all the other parodies. but for me this film is unique. for the first time since publicly ridiculed the most important disease of todays youth twilight. i hope after this film will be less fans of this saga.",negative
"its set in a fantastical victorian england, with journeys to lisbon, spain, alexandria, egypt, paris, france and the ships in between. it follows the work of dr. godwin baxter willem dafoe, a brilliant but eccentric doctor who can transplant brains and other bodily parts. he was experimented upon by his father and has an appearance not unlike frankensteins monster. one of his creations is bella baxter emma stone, a pregnant young woman who had attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge. although he knows nothing of her past, god, as his students refer to him, transplants her stillliving fetuss brain into emmas dead brain. his medical assistant is max mccandles ramy youssef. the movie follows emmas growth as she develops language skills beginning with infancy, with physical coordination occurring at a different pace and understanding sexuality, emotion, and human relationships at still different rates. godwin and max try to control her behavior tightly. godwins scoundrel lawyer, duncan wedderburn mark ruffalo, makes off with emma, claiming to give her freedom to explore the world. as emma matures, she makes more and more of her own decisions about her life, even when someone from her past life suddenly appears. poor things is a bizarre movie with no undergirding significance for me. theres inordinate attention to bellas sexuality to the exclusion of other parts of her personality, leaving me feeling that emma stone was unnecessarily exploited. there are many creative images e.g., composite animals, and the cinematography was different, with much use of a fisheye lens. there are many funny moments in poor things, but...",positive
"slender man the biggest problem with internet urban legends is that the supernatural entities are always so judgy and meanspirited. luckily, the meme monster in this horror movie doesnt have very much to say on any topic. when their friend annalise basso disappears, three teens joey king, jaz sinclair, julia goldani telles contact the fabled slender man, a featureless figure who haunts the web, for help in finding her. but during their meeting the girls make eyecontact with the gaunt giant and are cursed with madness. the only way to stop him now is to give him want he desires. inspired by the reallife legend that has claimed some real victims, this fictional account ignores reality opting for a more bloody mary vibe. unfortunately, the scares are cheap, the acting amateurish and the overall execution is hamfisted. besides, just like every scam on the internet, slender man is really a russian hacker. red light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",positive

i still think the first neverending story is the best of the series. i didnt so much like the second one as it was super cheese. this one is still super cheese but i enjoyed this movie. this version is so 90s. the music is so dance mix tape style. and i loved jack black as the bully. this movie is not as well done with the fantasia characters but i really liked the story line with bastions little sister. and the nice family moral at the end of the film. this movie is not as cool as the first one but maybe because im a kid of the 90s i liked this version because i can remember growing up in the 90s. hopefully they will not make anymore versions of the neverending story unless they do a really good job. falcor was so cheese in number three that i cant bare to see anymore movies made of this series unless they do an amazing job on a fourth one. i am so cringing the new lost boys tribe movie as it will be nowhere as good as the 80s original.,negative
"disney and pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named woody. however, when andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. woody is the leader of the toys in andys room, which include a mr. potato head, slinky the dog, rex the dinosaur, hamm the pig and bopeep the girl doll. however, when andys get new toy space ranger buzz lightyear for his birthday, buzz takes the place of woody of being leader of the toys and andys new best friend. brewing with jealously, woody attempts to get rid of buzz, but both ended up lost outside of andys house. as a result, they must find their way back to andys house before they move first trying to get through andys weird neighbor and toy torturer sid. this is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation very detailed and realistic. the story is full of surprises and adventure, from woody and buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of sids house to get back to andys. the movie is also filled with comedy you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. and, there are toetapping songs you would learn to love including randy newmans opening song youve got a friend in me. while this movies plot is full of nonstop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. while i mostly enjoyed this movie, i wished that woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after woodys jealous behavior towards buzz. i thought this takes away at woodys hero status too much especially for his first movie. but overall, this is one of disneys best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. also, hands down to a great voice cast tom hanks, tim allen, annie potts and jim varney. grade b",positive

"leave religion aside, and, if possible, stay very far from it. the two popes is not a religious movie. it is a homage to friendship and to how it can be found in the most adverse conditions. these same conditions are the ones that mold and found it forever. to say the truth, the two popes from the title are really anthony hopkins and jonathan pryce, two of the greatest actors of all time. hopkins builds the character of pope benedict xvi showing all the burden of his being conscious of his limitations as the catholic church chief. he accomplishes it magisterially, in such a way that we are compelled to feel sympathy for the rottweiller of god. nevertheless, it is pryce who has the most emotional and convincing performance, besides his incredible resemblance to the actual jorge bergoglio. fernando meirelles is capable of making the most of his two stars, both at the top of their careers. in addition, we have a final beatles touch in a story that emphasizes the importance of what is the most precious thing we can have in life a true friendship. amen.",positive

"released in 2014, left behind stars nicolas cage as an adulterous airplane pilot on a transatlantic flight who has to save the remaining passengers after many of them mysteriously disappear meanwhile his daughter back in new york cassi thomson struggles with the disappearance of her little brother and mother lea thompson. chad michael murray plays a famous reporter on the plane while nicky whelan plays a sexpot flight attendant. this is sortof a theatrical version of the 2000 directtovideo movie of the same name. i say sort of because its a severely truncated rendition, which doesnt mean its necessarily bad, but fans of the bestselling book will likely be disappointed by the smaller focus. it worked for me, however, and ill explain why momentarily but, first, lets consider two other reasons for the critical feeding frenzy some people might have been disappointed because they were expecting blockbuster quality when, in fact, the movie only cost 16 million. the original cost 4 million, in case you were wondering. while 16 million is enough to make an okay theatrical release, its not even close to the typical 100 million plus required to make a modern blockbuster disaster flick, like san andreas. as such, the movie has a glorified tvmovie vibe, which film snobs zeroin on and lambaste. another big reason for the ubernegative reviews, of course, is the christianthemed subject. since the average person understandably finds the very idea of faithful believers being snatched away in the blink of an eye ludicrous they hold the movie in contempt. what i dont get is why such people would even be interested in viewing a movie like this when they know up front that its based on a massively popular book with overt biblical themes. so why did i like this movie? because i was able to ignore the relatively lowbudget production and get involved in the lives of the characters and their amazing story. i say amazing because how else would you describe a situation in which masses of people, including all children, suddenly vanish with only their clothing left behind? it would be an incredible experience, to say the least, not to mention a serious wakeup call for those who remain. the movie effectively reflects this. in short, this is a what if? movie. you dont have to believe in the bible whatsoever to enter into the story of the characters and enjoy it for what it is a what if the rapture really happened movie. i dont believe in malevolent and wickedly ugly aliens with acid for blood, but that doesnt prevent me from liking the aliens flicks. furthermore, i appreciate the smaller focus of the story compared to the original movie. by doing this, it doesnt cut off more than it can chew. it focuses on one family and one airplane its passengers and drives its point home without being awkwardly preachy. lastly, cage and murray make for strong male protagonists while thomson and whelan are more than effective in the female department, including being extremely easy on the eyes. the film runs 110 minutes and was shot in baton rouge, louisiana and provo, utah. grade b",negative

"opened this up without a notion of what it contained, and the opening scenes put me on the edge of my seat w inclinations to stop playback due to the indications of a major cringeworthy affair. oddly enough, it turned out bad, but not that bad. heres the thing its decently casted cage of course being the lone big name, and sadly he delivers a performance subpar his other movies, fairly if mostly overacted, well shot, good choice of locations and good fx... but... on the other hand, what drags this thing down to ground level is that corniness of the plot and script, the odd musical choices, the deep hollowness under the the otherwise ok acting, and its boilerplate predictability. i scratch my head at how they could make this last 2 hours. and that speed2esque scene.... im sitting here with a frozen shoteating grin on my face. i dont mind a flick with a religious theme, as it is can provide a fresh breath of air from a cinematographic space that is increasingly being filled with movies made from the usual overused trope elements. this one however could have been done a lot better. i do wonder who will cringe the most at this movie... the nonbelievers or the believers. i have a feeling itll be the latter ones. verdict ok popcorn flick if you can stand the religious stuff. in any case youll have a good laugh at it afterwards. or longlasting chills up your spine. if the rel stuff is too much, you can justifiably consider this a laughable mess and do a 1 or 2. nicholas cage will also have the chills up his spine from taking the lead role of this thing.",negative

"another great white stalks the brody family, this time from amity island to the bahamas. this is worth watching for the entertainment value of its story and attempted visual spectacle. it also functions as a lesson to movie executives like sheinberg about when to let go of a franchise. in a movie that is so universally panned for its story and effects it would be pointless for me to put the boot in further, so i will highlight what i think are positives. personally, i think the actors do their best with bad material. lorraine gary, lance guest, karen young and michael caine have moments when they make their characters feel genuine as opposed to just players in a dodgy production. these for me are the scenes of interaction between characters that do not involve shark horror. i am not saying many are strong, but i think some of them work. gary would have been capable of carrying a better story, as her emotions and strength shine through in various moments, but overall there is very little material that showcases her ability. you can tell the filmmakers are clutching at straws for entertainment at times by sexualising youngs character in certain scenes, but at least she does make the character alluring. in fact, i think the scene where michael looks out of the bedroom window, with shadows of the rain cast on him, and carla flicks an item of clothing to get his attention is quite cinematic. caine plays his usual persona and his charismatic presence is enough to lift certain scenes but not the overall viewing experience. you have to admire the honesty of anyone who can see the positive by focussing on the house built with the acting fee. i think michael smalls musical score does a good job of enhancing certain sequences and making it more tense than deserved given the premise and footage captured. visually, i like the location shots in the bahamas, as it makes for a suitably tropical backdrop for the action taking place. if anything it is a reasonably good advert for the nassau area. i am not going waste any time restating all flaws associated with roaring sharks, the infamous finale and other generally dodgy nautical horror. it appears the actors and editor had very little material to work with in a rushed production. it made a relatively good profit at the box office so i guess the universal executives had the last laugh.",positive

"i have been using imdb for years have never posted a review but after seeing twows i felt i needed to finally enter the domain of amateur critics. ive always been a fan of scorseses since i was young, some of most memorable cinematic moments come from his earlier works but for me, when he teams with di caprio, its a match made in the highest reaches of moviemaking heaven. the departed is undoubtedly one of the best crime thrillers to ever hit theaters with outstanding performances from multiple cast members but the aviator was the role that took di caprio to that next level, scorsese provided him the stage to perform and carry the movie to what i feel will go down as one of the greatest artistic portrayals on film. everyone did not share my love for aviator but it looks to be a different story altogether with twows with the film already receiving fantastic reviews and praise despite the controversy about the extraordinary excess portrayed. for those who havent seen it and are sitting on the fence due to the criticism remember one thing, this is a scorsese movie and you are almost always certain to be a part of a truly visceral experience, scorsese is used to pushing the boundaries of what is usually acceptable to a mainstream audience and this is no different. at 3 hours the film never feels overdrawn, the characters are fantastically written which is attributed to terrance winters screenplay and some truly memorable performances jonah hill and matthew mcconaughy are both excellent but it is leonardo di caprios execution of one of the most sincere slime balls ever portrayed on film that you must watch this film for. the best achievement i attribute to it is that without him, for this movie to be any bit as good as it has turned out, you would only be looking at a very select few actors in the business. will he finally get an oscar? that remains to be seen..",negative

"i heard all the complaints from people, but decided to watch it before making up my mind about it. after watching it i can say with assurance that people are overhyping the issues with this movie. a 5 second dialogue does not represent the vision of the makers. this is not a remake of ramanand sagars ramayana. this a vision of the director. a characters appearance does not change their historically accurate attributes. there are definite issues with movie, but making an assertion without giving it a chance is unfair. moreover, the movie is made for close to 70 million. movies like ant man quantumania and black adam are made for almost triple the budget. the vfx is great considering the amount of vfx and the relatively low budget. cons 1. there was no need to cgi sri ram. prabhass normal built was acceptable. 2. they could have hired an actor who is already buffed to play hanuman ji. there was no need to cgi. a lot of vfx budget could have been saved on the above two points. 3. the introduction of sri ram did not need to have so much cgi. that scene felt like the cgi artists showing off what they can do. instead, that budget could have been utilized in improving the movements of jamvant and the balisugriv fight. 4. someone better could have played lakshman ji. the actor could not do justice to the nature of lakshman ji. pros 1. i expected saif to be the worst part of the movie, but turns out he was the best. he played the character really well. 2. the who played hanuman ji was great. 3. the visuals were mostly great. overall, i welcome negative reviews for the movie, but i urge people to watch the movie legitimately before making up their mind, weather its in a theatre or on an ott platform.",negative
"it is confusing to why any distributor would want to release a film explaining the background of a less noted character. catwoman is a very intriguing character but as the saying goes, some mysteries are better left unsolved. its good to leave the audience questioning the background of certain characters, otherwise the mind isnt allowed to explore and create the reasons why that character is the way they are. this version of catwoman tells the story of down on her luck artist patience phillips halle berry who ends up learning a dark secret behind the company that she works for. once she discovers the truth shes transformed into a human with super catlike reflexes by a bazillion year old tabby called midnight. and the fact that phillips is now called herself catwoman is not a new thing. according to the script, there have been woman picked by midnight to become this catwoman in the past. so in a sense, the term catwoman has now been generalized. so now its just a term for those specific ones chosen by midnight. its a neat theory, but this should have not been penned into the actual script that was to be approved. the whole concept of catwoman was about her strong interest in the way of the feline. to think that she was more inclined to just acting like a cat than having super skills like a cat was more acceptable. then theres the subplot of tom lone, a police officer, who dresses nothing like one. lone is played by benjamin bratt who ends up getting wound up in the usual superhero clich the superhero doesnt tell the lover who they really are until the lover finds out for himself or herself. plus, as any comic book fan would know, although catwoman loves to flirt with men, she never settles down. shes a solitary worker. and for almost the whole time during this movie, phillips is trying to settle down with lone. sharon stone also plays in here, and like most films, shes a baddie. still seductive, and still dangerous and thats good. which now leads to the few positives in this bad apple. halle berry as catwoman was a fair choice. berry can be alluring and quite lethal at the same time so thats a plus. the way she moves is also attractive and her skills are impressive even if there were times where i knew i was completely looking at cgi on the screen. that frustrated me, how could a production with such a high budget make a film with such obvious computer renderings? were better than that people! same goes for the cats too supposedly 43 cats were trained for this film. i only saw one real one and that was the cat who played midnight and even then, there were times where it looked completely fake. whats the deal?! however, the action scenes were nice. theyre not amazing or spectacular but they were entertaining none the less. the flexibility of catwoman was always cool to watch but thats about it. the dialog was too puny for me. there were too many lines that were said one right after the next that had a cat pun in the sentence. enough! this isnt a contest, screenwriters! not even the music by klaus badelt helped and hes not a bad composer either! his score to k19 the widowmaker 2002 was very moving but it feels like here, he got lazy. hey badelt, wake up! halle berry and sharon stone give passable performances as their characters but nothing else is really noteworthy. catwoman tries to entertain but it misses with each swipe it takes.",negative

"to make this clear i dont like watching animated films or shows im not a child anymore, i was flicking through netflix this morning and came across love death and robots i watched the trailer and thought this looks good but its animated what shall i do ignore it or give it a go if i dont like it i can just stop watching it so i just give it a go so i started to watch it wow this netflix series is brilliant i cant stop watching it i could watch this all day everyday and still not get bored of it. because im not into animated films or shows i like the shortness of each episode plus its not made for kids its an 18 or should be with the swearing, nudity, blood and violence in each episode. its well written and the animation in some episodes are so excellent they almost seem so real i know they are but from an animation perspective..... its brilliant what else can i say just keep up the great work and please have many episodes to come thankyou for your great work its been a great watch thankyou. anybody who isnt into animation like me just give it a go its a must watch.",positive
"well, i heard about this flick alot from nerdy college students. then i watched disaster artist, and then i tried to watch the original. i could not do it. at least i did not pay a dime for the privilege. given the budget, and shady persona of tommy wiseau, only two things come to mind. that this has been some sort of elaborate money laundering activity, or a general study of human idiocy financed on a bet by some whimsical, bored and shadowy figures who just happen to choose tommy to run the experiment. given, that by some accounts the movie brought in 30m in revenue, the experiment was a success. you can sell anything! i am wondering that nobody is curious enough to investigate tommy wiseau privately of course. to find out some basic things like how old is he, where is he from and the source of his fortune. may be he is from another planet? may be on that other planet he watched mulholland drive and decided that he could do the same?",negative
"it genuinely pains me when i have to say that a movie has absolutely nothing going for it, but, in the case of this celluloid trainwreck, i can come up with no other way to describe it. this overlong, frequently implausible, gratuitously violent, truly stupid offering from directors dan berk and robert olsen is one of the worst excuses for a film that i have ever seen, and im not exaggerating when i say that. the film tells the story of nick caine a.k.a. novocaine jack quaid, a 30something credit union assistant manager who suffers from a rare genetic disorder that shields him from experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort when injured, even though the physical damage to his body is real enough. hes something of a sheltered, geeky milquetoast, having lived much of his life isolated from many of its everyday experiences as a means to protect him from potential undue harm. so its highly inconceivable that he somehow knows how to skillfully handle himself when caught up in a robbery of his workplace and his subsequent oneman amateur pursuit of the bad guys when they escape with a hostage, one of the facilitys tellers amber midthunder, who also happens to be his new girlfriend. however, as this scenario plays out, the narrative grows progressively more preposterous with every passing frame, much of it designed to show how many times he can be shot, beat up and brutally hacked apart without ever feeling anything and yet still be able to keep going with his mission. because of this, the sequence of events becomes increasingly repetitive, evermore farfetched and just plain dumb, with ridiculous, overthetop plot developments that fail to engage and frequently feature incongruous and unoriginal dialogue. but, to add real insult to injury, this release bills itself as a comedy but is virtually devoid of humor except a smattering of oneliners that mostly fall flat. this offering is so ineptly executed that it makes productions like joker 2 and the john wick movies look like masterpieces by comparison. indeed, if youve watched the trailer for this one, youve seen all you really need to see. novocaine is a sorry excuse for contemporary filmmaking and a prime example of everything thats wrong with the domestic motion picture industry these days, a cinematic cautionary tale for film school students on how not to make a movie. by all means, skip this one, even when it becomes available for streaming.",positive

"it had promise, but it wasted it all. the breakfast club is one of those movies that sound beautiful but when i watched it i found it undercooked in almost every way and then the ending was cloying, featured bipolar characters and went completely against the message it was trying to send. ill give the film props for the five exceptional performances. estevez and ringwald inhabit their characters well, but the show is stolen completely by anthony michael hall as brian the dork and ally sheedy as allison the basket case. judd nelson is firmly in control of his character all times and is completely superb at all times. whatever the characters need to do is handled superbly by the actors. john hughes also provides key directorial choices, such as the characters lunches and how hughes characters completely ignore brian because despite all their problems he is still the least popular. the dance scene in the film is delightful in isolation and theres something beautiful about watching the three boys in particular dance together. he breakfast club has a beautiful message that never gets across. i never bought any of the friendships because large portions of the plot felt rushed. it takes over an hour for the kids to even get on good terms. after that, theres some good stuff, but let me break down why the breakfast club craps the bed on its own message. its meant to be a story about how five people with problems can become friends for one day. how are the relationships at the end of the film brian and claire probably the most underrated connection, she responds and says that its okay to be a virgin as we later find out that she is as well, a huge deal from one of the most popular girls in school. brian later finds the courage to tell her to shut up when she condescends him. however, this goodwill is all undone when she manipulates him with compliments into doing all of their detention essays for them. rather than parting as equals, brian ends up being the bottom of the barrel. allison and claire no interaction between the girls until claire suddenly decides to make allison look pretty. honestly, i think she looked better before. the problem here is that all of the relationships are forced, counterproductive and harmful to each other. rather than feeling touched, i came away feeling sour because now brian is the fifth wheel for a pair of couples when the film had no business doing that. brian is in a way the most important character of the film, and likely the one that many identify with the most. however, his character is completely left out in the cold because now we have two couples. now instead of remembering the day and breakfast club fondly, both boys will just remember their respective girl. honestly, i think brian was better off without the breakfast club. i dont agree with a number of directorial and writing choices, notably the emotional manipulation of the audience who are supposed to feel something for bender distracting vern so the others can return safely to the library undetected. are we meant to forget that they left to fetch weed something i cant see brian or claire doing and only at benders urging to begin with? vern is used inconsistently throughout he hears raised voices at the beginning of the film and yet cannot smell marijuana smoke or hear a person falling through a roof. his interactions with bender are also inconsistent, with bender suddenly affected by his insults even though they only marginally differ from what hes been saying before. instead of its beautiful message, the breakfast club goes forward and imparts the following",negative
"wow. i only have one question...should i call this a movie?? no, im being serious. in fact, this totally counts as a pathetic attempt to a funny scary movie rerun which was homemade by a bunch of mindless wannabedirector nerds. i totally agree with its abysmal 2star imdb rating but i fail to understand why its not in the bottom 100. everything about this movie is stupid. the gags were hideous. not a single point in the movie that i actually found them funn...er..funny. but suprisingly i actually found one thing funny about this movie. its the attempts for laughter. the film makers spent like a year pointlessly trying to whip up laughable script jokes to entertain the audience, when in the actual film, they ended up not delivering. how dumb?! and the film characters that they were trying to mock! narnia, harry potter, pirates of the caribbean?! i mean come on!! youre just mocking yourselves! overall, ill sum it up by saying the film makers wasted a year of their life trying to make this junk and every bad word in this word describes how lame this movie is. one of the worst films ive ever seen. epic movie? should be called epic failure!",negative
"four episodes in and im thoroughly hooked. there are so many great characters in this that every one of them could run off on their own and build their own colony i think they call that a spinoff series. i love how everyone had a lot more to them than meets the eye. just when you think youve run into a stereotype or a clich, that person surprises you with an original take on what you had already mapped out in your head. at the end of e4 eva makes a joke about how she doesnt know how to swim. i wont spoil it except to say it was a great joke. however, overall, there arent nearly enough good jokes in this series about a comedian. i love the thirty minute episodes as opposed to the sometimes lumbering fortyfive minutes of most dramas which take a lot of commitment for a show you may not even like all that much. what really makes the series, especially the comedy, are all of the people filling the supporting roles. her agent, jimmy, and his absurdly incompetent assistant, kayla, are hilarious together. everyone is highly likeable, even marty who is sort of in the role of the villain.",positive

"examining the rotten core beneath the surface urbanity of suburbia is something that has attracted filmmakers as diverse as alfred hitchcock, david lynch, and joe dante. more recently, novels such as gillian flynns gone girl and its subsequent filmic adaptation, have expanded and popularised the suburban noir genre the very genre that a simple favours satirical excesses primarily target. a semicomedic look at the lives of two young mothers in an affluent american suburb, coupled with a mystery plot, the film has an undeniable identity crisis due to its genre mashup characteristics. although director paul feig proves adept at handling the parodic side of things, in the latter stages, he seems to be trying to ensure the film can exist relatively unironically within the very genre its attempting to lampoon. despite this schizophrenic quality, however, the interplay between the two leads, the heavy stylisation, the playfully selfaware nature of the aesthetic, and the success of the burlesque elements all serve to make the film undeniably entertaining. adapted by from s 2017 novel, a simple favour tells the story of stephanie smothers , a widowed singlemum who runs a life hacks vlog with minimal viewership. enter emily nelson , a public relations executive for a major fashion label. soon after meeting, the two are bonding over increasingly strong martinis and girl chats, with stephanie in awe of emily, who seems to have it all a goodlooking novelistlecturer husband, sean , a gorgeous house, a successful career, a great kid, and an acerbic attitude that stephanie would kill for. several weeks later, with emily held up at work, she asks stephanie to pick up her son, and shell collect him later. except she doesnt collect him. as a few days go by, and no one seems to know where emily is, stephanie and sean report her missing. however, unsatisfied with the direction the investigation is taking, stephanie is soon amateur sleuthing her way across the country in an effort to track down her friend. a simple favour is at its best when working as a parodysatire of mommy murder mysteries, gently and often not so gently ribbing the genre, and exposing some of its more illconceived and unrealistic tropes to ridicule. for example, the three main characters are all standard generic templates to the point of clich the ingnue who feels honourbound to do everything she can to find the truth the sardonic, caustic, and utterly shady plot catalyst, who always seems to have an ace up her sleeve and, the brilliant but frustrated spouse who may, or may not, be in on the crime at the narratives centre. however, their archetypal characteristics are dialled up to such a degree that they cant help but seem caricatures. similarly, everything is presented in such a nonchalant and laid back manner that the twists, which in a more selfserious film would occupy centre stage, are often rendered absurd. however, and this is the key point, a simple favour is very much in on the joke. most of the time. opening with a late 1960s europopinfluenced esque title sequence complete with sliding splitscreens and pastel colours, scored to jean paul kellers 1967 ca sest arrange, the film signals its playful tone right from the off. this emphasis on stylisation is perhaps seen most clearly upon emilys introduction. as stephanie shelters from the rain, emily emerges from a car in slow motion, with the camera starting on her feet before slowly moving up to her head as she raises an umbrella. cutting to a midshot, she then begins to walk across the carpark still in slow motion, as a broken umbrella blows past her, replacing the tumbleweed of a classic western shootout. apart from being a memorable introduction to the character, the visual design of the scene is predicated on cineliteracy, showing that the filmmakers are more than aware of standard genre tropes, and, more importantly, how to employ them for comedic effect. indeed, the entire film revels in its own intertextual awareness, with later references to such defining noir texts as , , and . another element of this awareness is the use of a fractured narrative structure, so beloved of classic noir mysteries. large portions of the film feature narration within narration, as well as making use of another classic noir staple the unreliable narrator. the film gets significant mileage out of scenes where the aural narration doesnt even come close to matching the visuals. an especially funny example of this is when stephanie tells emily about kissing her stepbrother after their fathers funeral, and emily immediately knows she is lying that she only kissed him. whilst the narrator stephanie flatout denies she slept with him, the audience sees them having sex, confirming the narratees emily suspicions. this technique is used several times in the film, and its an extremely wellhandled narrative device. the films main target for satire, however, is not really a specific genre suburban noir or even the tropes that define that genre its the milieu that enables the existence of that genre in the first place. together, stephanie, emily, and sean represent everything thats rotten with the sterilised, emotionally deadening middleclass suburban sphere in which theyre seemingly trapped. however, the film doesnt condemn them for being horrible people, rather it exults in their awfulness, deftly directing, redirecting, and misdirecting the audiences sympathies, to the point where it becomes difficult to say who is screwing over whom. every time the film seems to settle on who the villains are, it disrupts the audiences perceptions, and oftentimes, so as to achieve maximum satirical impact, precisely when the character we are now being asked to empathise with is up to something somewhat less than moral. this is the very essence of black comedy the film presents a hideous world populated by hideous people who do hideous things to one another, but it does so in such a cheerful and uplifting manner that you simply cant help but laugh at the shenanigans. in relation to this, the film works especially well when jauntily charting the friendship between stephanie and emily, two women who have no businesses coexisting. kendrick essentially plays the same character she has in every performance in her career thus far, but it works here because, a its the perfect foil to the screwyou persona of emily, and b kendrick and lively have such effortless chemistry. lively plays emily as a mischievous, experienced charmer, the kind of person who acts like they know your secrets ten seconds after meeting you, whilst kendricks stephanie is all selfdeprecating intellectualism, trailedoff sentences, and statements phrased like questions. if there was one element of the film that didnt work, however, it was the mystery plot. yes, i get that its all a satire of the multitwistfortwistssake suburban murder mystery, with the preposterousness of such plots played for maximum farcicality. however, the satirical underpinning doesnt change the fact that the entire mystery at the films centre is insipid, uninteresting, and predictable, with feig unable to bridge the tone of the frothier comic moments and the darker ones which become increasingly prevalent towards the end. granted, the film is not a spoof, la something like , so we cant expect absurdist humour throughout, but nevertheless, rather than choosing to employ a relatively even tone, feig seems to have made the decision to mix scenes of outright comedy with predominantly serious scenes devoid of laughter. and it doesnt work. for example, the film features a scene in which someone who has just been ploughed by a car and is trying to crawl away is nonchalantly told if they dont stop, theyre going to hurt their knees. thats pretty dark, but its also pretty funny. however, it comes only a short while after a scene in which a drugaddict is held under the water and drowned. not a huge amount to laugh at there. if scenes of this nature are supposed to be satiric, and hence feed into the films engagement with the suburban noir, i couldnt see any evidence of it. for all that, however, i found a simple favour enjoyable. the purelysatirical early scenes earn enough goodwill so that the less successful more plotheavy later scenes dont completely tear the whole thing down. the film as a whole shines a not unwelcome light on the increasingly selfimportant suburban noir, and for the most part, the parody is very well judged. when the comedy is forced to retreat in the service of more serious material, the tonal balance is definitely knocked off, as the film comes dangerously close to valorising that which it has set out to mock. despite this, however, a simple favour remains entertaining. distractingly attractive people wear ridiculously stylish clothes in a stylised cineliterate parody it wont change your life, but its a very rewarding couple of hours.",negative
"this movie has bmovie written all over it. its has a typical bmovie action atmosphere, a silly story, stereotypical characters and a lot of bactors. im not a pamela anderson hater, she is a real character. she was well casted and is perhaps one of the few reasons why this movie isnt a complete disaster. further more the movie is filled with some well known, mostly bactors, such as xander berkeley, udo kier and clint howard. those three appear in just as many good well known movies, as silly ones, like this movie is. they make this movie a bmovie fan heaven. its mainly the story that makes this movie a bad one. the story is very uninteresting and most of the characters are very dull. the movie lacks a real main villain and because of this the movie also never becomes really tense. it was also weird to see the villains walk around in nazilooking like uniforms. it felt highly unnecessary and was just plain silly and unbelievable for the story. some of the action in the movie is good but its nothing memorable, just like the whole movie in general. only watchable and recommendable to fans of bmovies. for them this is a must see in a way, everyone should just skip this movie. 410 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com",negative

"wow, where to start. for this review i will not spoil because the cameoscharacters were super well kept even from a fan like me who seeks out rumors and scoops. compared to endgame, spiderman no way home and others, speculation and rumors were a bit more obvious. for the most part marvel studios did a very good job hiding a good chunk. let me start off by saying, most of us dont count the xmen origns wolverine film, and because of that i always kinda had a feeling that one day ryan would convince hugh, and that hugh would eventually have a change of heart and return for this, because a proper deadpool wolverine film without these two would have been an absolute missed opportunity. on a side note, its precisely the reason i never bought a hot toy of deadpool and wolverine on the chance that this would happen. if you know what hot toys 16 scale figures are, kudos to you. so here we are and i can tell you right now that its the movie that many thought doctor strange in the multiverse of madness was expected to be. some cameos that werent revealed in the marketing, but were speculated was kind of obvious due to ryan being particularly close with some of his actor friends, but there are cameos and characters that have actual meaningful roles. you would never have guessed that these particular characters deadpool and wolverine interact with would be in a movie like this and be played by that said actor. if youre a giant comicbooksuper hero genre fan, you will be surprised. deadpool wolverine is equally the story of two characters, and also a story of two movies. one of which that celebrates the best of foxs marvel and uses the fox legacy characters extremely well, in a way that goes beyond empty cameos. the other is a mundane story that at times struggles to bring it all together, but good enough to get by the film as it is carried by the performances from ryan and hugh. at this point ryan reynolds and hugh jackman can do this in their sleep. born to play these roles and eventually they will one day hang it up for good second retirement for hugh as hes pulling an mj, so we just need to appreciate what we have now. were also now at an age where the talented visual development artists and costume designers can embrace the colorful and out there nature of superhero suits, so to finally see hugh in the yellow and blue just hits the feels. emma corrin plays the films antagonist cassandra nova and they are very good. they chew up the scenery, but like traditional mcu fashion it is a villain that is underdeveloped. not the worst like many others, but they got the short end of the stick. matthew macfadyen plays mr. paradox, a tva agent that has ambitions of his own. i havent watched succession, but im told its similar to his character in the show. leslie uggams and rob delany also get a shoutout as blind al and peter. as one should expect, tons of profanity and action that are all great fun and super violent. deadpool has a lot of fun at the expense of the current state with the mcu. with the exception of spiderman no way home, the mcu has been bloated and unfocused post endgame and deadpools fourth wall breaking holds nothing back about it, some kevin feige and meta jokes hit too. if you ever read my reviews i feel there is a time and place for humor, and certainly for a character like deadpool a lot of the comedy works. director shawn levy deserves some praise for this juggling act, as do the writers rhett reese, paul wernick, and zeb wells. also kudos to something you wont see on screen, but i felt that the film has that balance between being accessible to the general movie going audience, while also satisfying the well versed diehard fans of the source material and films. deadpool wolverine is an extremely fun ride. i think its easily the best of the three deadpool films. that doesnt mean that the mcu is entirely cured from its current state, but this definitely puts it back slightly on track. despite some of the same problems most of the mcu movies face, the backbone of the this film is carried through ryan reynolds and hugh jackman, and how the film uses the other characters in meaningful fashion. ill be curious to see how it will be received down the line when the novelty wears off, but for now it did duplicate the level of hype and feelings similar of spiderman no way home and i would place this in the higher tier of the bunch within the mcu and fox. 910.",positive

"if youve seen the goodfellas or casino, then youll know the story of the wolf of wall street. this is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, outofcontrol substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about whitecollar crime. the guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film. based on the memoirs of jordan belfort the reallife stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes the film showcases one seriously messedup slimeball of a man. if his scheme sounds familiar, its because its been the inspiration behind the 2000 film boiler room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. the film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. and it is extreme the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. the sheer corruption becomes palpable onscreen, and i couldnt help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when i saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. i have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the reallife events, but at times its almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. and yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the american dream the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hardhitting downfall. this film features goodlooking photography and editing. acting is great leonardo dicaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well including jonah hill, who seems to fit into his characters archetype very comfortably. writing is really sharp and good the film is full of great lines and great speeches. there are some greatlooking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. music has a varied mix of songs, and theyre all used really well for their intended effect. the wolf of wall street is every bit as good as martin scorseses previous work with the goodfellas and casino. all these films work with similar plots and themes, but twows is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upperclass corporate swindling. it is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the superrich, crime still doesnt pay. recommended! 4.55 entertainment good story very good film perfect",negative
"i remember being taken to see this by my mother when i was 9. it was so bad that it was truly disorienting. i remember asking my mother afterward whether this was actually made by creatures on mars and whether the actors really spoke english or were just faking it. the lip synching was awful. its only now that i can appreciate my mothers sacrifice! id say now that if you know its awful going in, fine. but kids are going to get confused how can santa claus be in such an unbelievably shoddy production? leave this one for the adults who want campy entertainment.",negative
"this film from lock, stock and two smoking barrels creator guy richie is centred on more gangsters, hard men and chancers. the intertwining story lines feature turkish and tommy, a couple of unlicensed boxing promotors who get in a spot of bother when their fighter gets beaten by one punch mickey, an irish gypsy, just before a fixed fight... the boys must get mickey to fight for them if they are to avoid being fed to the pigs by mobster brick top. meanwhile franky four fingers has stolen an eighty six carat diamond in antwerp only to go missing in london... many people are after the diamond. inevitably the two plots will eventually collide. there may be a fair amount of violence and few of the characters are really that nice but this film is a lot of fun. there are laughs in most scenes whether it is the sight of incompetent thieves trying to rob a bookies which has no money, a dog that squeaks because it has swallowed a squeaky toy or gangsters armed with replica pistols the gags all hit the mark. the cast is large but the characters are all very distinctive so one is unlikely to get confused about who is who. i dont think there were any weak links amongst the cast which includes the likes of jason statham, brad pitt, benicio del toro, vinnie jones and dennis farina amongst others. not surprisingly brad pitt is probably the most memorable with his fine performance as mickey a character whose accent is deliberately almost impossible to understand at times. overall id say that it doesnt matter that the film is more style than substance... that doesnt matter when it is as much fun as this. if you liked lock, stock you will want to see this.",negative
"i think 2 things have happened with both the rating here and peoples general outlook to the film. first ill explain about an experiment done quite some time ago. some researchers made sweets that looked like dog poo then recorded the reactions to them. they werent all that good people didnt even want to eat them let alone give it a good rating. the exact same thing has happened here , bols repuation proceeded him here and it seems to have the same effect while people are watching the film. the film is grate in my opion uwe did a fantistic job made it witty, funny and full of good action and stunts. but ooo theres a saw word in todays world stunts not special effects and the far cry crowed was expecting the latter. this is the second bit im chatting about because uwe has gone for a good old fashioned shoot all the pc gamers feel its a crap film. well its not, i watched the film with my stoner mates and we loved it. every film now days is 3 hours long pumped full of special effects and no personality at all this has that and uwe has a good sense of humor to. the stunts are oldschool, perhaps to much use of slow mo but it seems not to matter in the end. the budget isnt amazing and shows but apart from that the film is good and to top it off a decent tribute to far cry. my personal opion is people should watch a film with a open mind before they rate it.",negative
"have you ever played 2k and your players keep missing even though they are wide open and there name is steph curry, and your body boils with rage because you know that not in a million years they would miss that shot? and so you are extremely annoyed and angry? that is exactly what this movie makes me feel. even if you dont play 2k, you probably understand exactly what i am saying. this movie makes me angry. here are my reasons why 1. the soundtrack. it is the worst. sounds like elevator music but 100 times worse. 2. the dialogue. they take forever to say their lines you wonder if they forget their lines and someone is trying to whisper them their lines because they totally forgot what they said, so it takes them like 6 seconds to remember their lines. also their voices are annoying and just old. 3. plot is just stupid and boring even though i know this is from the 60s i cant help but hate this movie. avoid at all costs. it is not one of those so awful its good like sharknado. it is so bad it is torturing to the soul and body. if mrbeast did another solitary confinement and they made him watch this, he would quit in 30 minutes.",negative

"what we have here is a film with great potential. potential to become one of the great dystopian films. it raises such themes as a nation obsessed by television, the means used to provide people their purile entertainment without any consideration of ethics nor human dignity. truman could be a great tragedy. we could see one man live a meaningless life, forever watched by millions of big brothers, completely unaware of his fishbowl existence. a warning, pointing to the disconnect and disassociation we all experience upon seeing someone on a television screen. and also to our slavish instinct to glorify these people without knowing why we adore them. and i cant help but think of this when i see all the thousands of mediocrities line up to make complete fools of themselves on national tv on socalled reality shows all in the name of a few brief and unmemorable moments of fame. weve been brainwashed by the media into believing that fame it itself, is a desirable virtue. but this movie, instead of exploring these issues in depth, skirts around them, afraid of giving itself intellectual depth and weight. instead were treated to jim careys charming smile and empty acting. this film has the potential to be a memorable and indepth dystopian vision of fame and the media. instead, out of pure cowardice, its turned into another meaningless popcorn movie. a complete waste of celluloid. all the people involved in this should be ashamed of themselves.",negative

"this show follows the adventures of 4 different people thrown together by chance on the ship bebop in the late 21st century. 3 of them are bounty hunters the wet blanketesquire excop jet, the ultra slick former mafia assassin spike, and the headstrong fay, a young female anachronism revived from hibernation more than a century after her time. the 4th member is child computer genius edward, an eccentric girl to say the least. all 4 of these people have a past that confronts them during the course of the series and is resolved. the series is short, merely 26 episodes, and the story telling is minimalist also truly postmodern yet each episode is complete. the way that the characters interact with each other is simple and believable. the animation is exactly what it needs to be, not overly reliant on pyrotechnics nor so bare that it looks incomplete. the action sequences rival anything hollywood has ever done and the direction leaves nothing to be desired. the visuals of the show have an ultramodern feel without the sense of lacking one would get from looking at other modern visual art such as an andy warhol painting or a skyscraper. special attention should be paid to the music, which is in one word incredible. elements of jazz, blues, rock, and other various types are traceable in the shows score. imagine mozart but less rigid, or wagner but more downtoearth, and a lot more varied than either. in summary, this show is simply excellent. nothing is overdone or incomplete, and the score is brilliant. it is short enough for anyone to get into and interesting enough for anyone to enjoy. truly what the postmodern movement was trying to accomplish.",positive
"im in no hurry to get in the boxing ring with director uwe boll, a man who has been known to use his pugilistic skills to silence his less favourable critics, but i have got to say that this horroraction film apparently based on an atari video game is utterly diabolicalfar worse than i ever expected my opinion of boll had been reasonably high after seeing rampage, which was surprisingly effective. the longwinded opening narration is the first clue that this is going to stink ancient civilisations, evil creatures from another world, a secret organisation devoted to investigation of the paranormal, and a mad scientist experimenting on orphaned children are clumsily thrown together in an attempt to establish the background to the film, but they only succeed in confusing the viewer before things have even begun. matters are made even more incomprehensible with a prologue that occurs 22 years ago but which segues into the present day and proceeds to introduce even more mindbogglingly random elements to ensure that even the most astute of viewers will be completely baffled. as the film progresses, more and more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into the mix, bolls pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible to follow, with the occasional voiceover by christian slater intended to help explain matters only adding to the embarrassment factor. ridiculous voiceovers aside, slaters performance isnt all that bad, but his costar tara reid is absolutely terrible and was clearly hired for her looks yet she doesnt even have the decency to take off her bra during the obligatory sex scene!. after much frenetic shooting, a smattering of reasonably fun gore, some choice snippets of lousy dialogue some doors are meant to stay shut and lots of naff cgi creature attacks, during which boll throws in some lousy indiana jonesstyle adventure and a scene completely ripped off from james camerons aliens the xenosyes the monsters are called thatobliterate a team of soldiers, despite the use of automated sentry guns, the film wraps up leaving the viewer none the wiser about what they have witnessed.",negative

"this anime is more than just an anime, its a deep reflection about the ephemeral aspects life. the story starts with a band of heroes reminiscing about their latest and glorious adventure where they defeated a great demon. this is basically the ending for any movie or series, where the heroes triumph over evil. but in sousou no frieren, thats not the important part! this is just a launching pad to frierens deeper reflections about the fleeting moments in her existence. shes an elf, who lives for centuries, so a few years adventure is nothing to her own lifespan, but is significant for the mortal humans who knew her. thus, frieren embarks on a new adventure, gathering a new band of heroes, but this time, shes often pausing to learn more about relationships and emotions, something that she didnt care to do before, because it didnt seem to be worth it for her. and as she learns more about humanity during her flashbacks, her eyes expresse a sense of guilt, for having ignored all the priceless little things in life that end up as forgotten memories. the anime is slow paced, some might complain about this, but i think its done for a good reason. frieren often walks slowly while engaging in all sorts of discussions with her companions, however her pace actually reflects the pace of her own existence, shes in no rush to do anything, she has all the time in the world to achieve things. once you realize this, the pace doesnt matter anymore, because we get absorbed by her characters development. for a while i thought the rest of the series would be like that, but no, there are several surprise scenes where frierens immense power is set on display. frieren is not a gentle idle elven mage. she can be ruthless, but for good reasons. im still watching the first season and im enjoying every bit of it, looking forward for season two, its been announced in september 2024.",positive

"considering that there are a bazillion reviews for this film already, i really dont think its that important that i do an indepth review of this film. it is already well in the top 100 films on imdb, so its obviously a very good film. instead of the usual view of the film, ill talk about it from a psychological perspective. amlie is a nice lady who is severely hindered by an avoidant personality. this means that shes so worried about being rejected by others that she always keeps her distance from themparticularly anyone who could become intimate. in other words, instead of being actively involved with others, she lives a life of quiet desperationhoping that somehow things will work themselves out but completely terrified to act. so, she sublimates her energy into doing things to help othersbut always at a distance and anonymously. most of the things she does for others are very quirky and strangebut ultimately very helpful and kind. in one of the cases, however, she attempts to gain retribution for an emotionally abused young man through passiveaggressive actions. fortunately for her, she meets a man who is also avoidant his hobby is very detached yet shows an interest in others...but how can two such obvious misfits who are afraid of commitment find a way to connect?! aside from the psychological aspects of the film, i really appreciated the look of the film. the odd 1930s style of amlies clothing and the homes in the film, the choice of colors with lots of sepia tones, the cinematic tricks and the quirky little gimmicks such as the pictures and lamp in her room coming to life all help to make this a magical picture that you cannot forget. overall, a delight. oddly, however, despite the very high rating, i think that audrey tautou mas made better films, such as he loves me...he loves me not and a very long engagement.",positive

"i always thought this was one of charlie chaplins nicest, most underappreciated silent movie gems. then i discovered it really wasnt underrated its rated very high on most critics lists. it may be that i usually hear about some of his other movies than i do this one. part of the reason i think so highly of this is simply that im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. its a romance between charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. virginia cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which i found very attractive. im not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like chaplin, harold lloyd and buster keaton, but chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by 1931. chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. he gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and i particularly laughed i love slapstick at the boxing scene. kudos, too, to harry myers as the eccentric millionaire. theres a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86minute gem as the tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight. comedy, romance, drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment. its hard to believe this movie was not up for one, single academy award.",positive

"watching dbe i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire dragonball series. the characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. i wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. it almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. the only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about master roshi and yamcha. for one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. i can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with goku and the bullies is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. the big screen debut of the kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the ki blasts look like different color fire balls. they dont look pure energy like they are in the anime but just like slow motion fire. i could go on for hours about what they did wrong. if you have never seen the anime series dont watch the movie. the story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesnt know the entire backstory of the anime. the movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. in fact i think why sums up the entire movie. why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. at the end of the movie all i could do was ask why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for? this is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. it feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime. as a fan of the series i will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls.",negative

"this show was seriously one of the best prime time comedies ever for maybe 4 seasons. thats only reason i rated this a 4. everything was great, seemed original, it was funny, and everyone looked forward to watching it. then it started to become a drag. storylines would build up with great expectations only to fizzle out and go nowhere. most of the kid actors grew up and became unfunny and cringeworthy. plot lines and punchlines became so played out and repetitive eventually the show became intolerable to even watch. if you have never seen this show dunno how because reruns are everywhere stop watching after season 5 or youll begin to hate anything to do with this show. i skipped many episodes of later seasons and eventually stopped recording it because it was that bad. i did watch the finale and even that was terrible. they really beat a dead horse with this one. instead of milking every penny out of it, they should have shortened the seasons to focus more on content and not so much meaningless filler. seriously went from vip to the dumpster.",positive
"this show didnt get my attention first when i saw it on comedy central, but once i started watching it from the first episode i fell in love with it. the characters are great, the script is full of absurd and cringy situations, the writers are brilliant. and i like how ed oneills character, jay is so different from al bundy. if youre looking for an actually funny comedy experience with lots of laughs, look no more, you found it.",positive
"i have had a glance at the bad reviews of date movie in imdb but as a fan of alyson hannigan since she performed willow in buffy, i decided to give a chance to this film. date movie is a gross parody of bridget joness diary, shallow hall, hitch, my big fat greek wedding, meet the fockers, when harry met sally, kill bill, lord of the rings, king kong and many other films. sophie monk and carmen electra are very sexy and give the necessary eroticism of the plot. i would never go to the movie theaters to see this type of movie, but what else could i expect from a spoof? my vote is four. title brazil uma comdia nada romntica a comedy not romantic",negative
"this was the worst movie any of us have ever seen. usually when i see a movie i absolutely loathe i might say something like one of the worst movies ever or one of the worst movies ive ever seen. not the case this time unfortunately. i can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, i simply can not recollect any movie ive seen let alone any movie ive seen which was at one point released in theaters which was worse than this. i dont so much mind that the special effects in this movie arent even on par with the likes of the boring garbage they send straight to the scifi channel. i dont mind so much that there isnt one good performance in this movie. heres my problem with this movie. we get a 2 minute backstory history lesson on the history and culture of an ancient indian tribe that is nothing more than white letters on black screen. when the movie starts, it has just about nothing to do with anything we just saw. the movie continues like this for the next hour and 40 minutes. it felt like there were like....eight eighths of eight different movies which, just coincidentally had the same cast members, edited onto one film strip. the entire movie is incredibly disjointed and leaves so many plot holes its unbearable. to me it felt like every scene which moved the plot forward was just introducing new and random pieces of the puzzle which dont even fit together. nothing ever ties back to anything. not to mention the awesome slow mo wire work hand to hand fights which look nothing short of ridiculous and out of place and gun fights which use some video gameizing techniques which would look sub par and stupid on the console video game system that the game of the same name was originally released on. just so none of you get it twisted.....i refused to pay money for this movie so i bought a ticket for million dollar baby and snuck in to this.....trust me....go see million dollar baby. the only way i can recommend this movie is if youd like to know what the worst movie all time would look like so that you can appreciate every other movie youll ever see more.",negative
"went into this one knowing two things. it stars the dude from the boys and it is about a guy who cannot feel pain. did not watch the trailer so we had no expectations with it. it is your classic setup. guy meets girl. guy falls in love. girl gets kidnapped. guy goes through absolute hell to get her back. which usually involving him getting absolutely brutalized in ways that should not be survivable. but he keeps on trucking because yanno the power of love and also the fact that he cannot feel anything that is done to him. you really have to suspend your disbelief here with this movie because i dont care if he cannot feel any pain some of the trauma his body goes through would kill a normal man for sure. if you can look past that you get a kinda mid actionthrillercomedy? with some fun yet horrific scenes. on that note, this movie is pretty brutal. the action is graphic, the violence is over the top, and the main guy takes an absolute beating in ways that made me question if he was part cartoon character. i do not care if he cannot feel pain, at some point his body would have just shut down. in the end, the story itself was serviceable and it had a pretty decent twist in the second act. it was weird that a lot of the horrific injuries he gets are played more for laughs, but other times not? i know this is supposed to be somewhat of a dark comedy, but i dunno. i give this one 5 deep fryer accidents outta 10.",positive
"when i watched the first series i was not sure what to expect because i thought what can happen in an office , and wont it be boring after the first few episodes ?? boy, was i wrong !!!!! ive just finished watching series 5 and this is one of the only shows where i laugh out loud with every episode that i watch and that means a lot to me at this very day what with most of the shows i watch i cant do better than a silent grin. in fact this and friends are the only shows that i can rate the almighty 10, because of course a show can never be flawless , but with that in mind they deserve the highest score i can give them.",positive
"when i first heard about this show, a remake of a british comedy, i thought it was going to be lame. i hadnt seen the original, but the very thought of americanizing a british tv show for stateside audiences sounded ridiculous. then i actually saw the show and was hooked from the starti dont believe there is anywhere else on tv where the uncomfortable, deadon, dry comedy of the office is available, and i end up laughing out loud at every episode. the characters and situations are pretty flawlessly put together, and i have and would recommend it to anyone. just for the record, after enjoying the american office so much, i did see the original british office as well. i think that, although the pilot episodes for each are basically identical, the american version evolved in a rather different direction. i really enjoyed the more bawdy, dark edge of the british office, but the american version is just an entirely different show, especially as it got into its second season. both versions are worth a watch.",positive
"batman and robin face the challenge of the deadly mr.freeze, poison ivy and bane as well as a jealousy conflict between each other and a new partner in bat girl.they must work together to stop freeze from icing the entire city of gotham. after batman forever everyone should know his batman films are an homage to the old campy comics and cheesy tv series.batman and robin is as openly, blatantly obvious about being over the top and corny that anyone who takes it seriously is missing the point.you really think that the genius behind the lost boys and the number 23 would give us scenes like batman playing ice hockey with bad guys, sky surfing, the dr.woodrow character, bat nipples on the suit, and batman pulling out the bat credit card to buy a night with poison ivy while trying to make a serious batman movie...please! the acting is absolutely hilarious and every bit as campy as the rest of the film.the magnificent actors all give hilarious over the top performances as very eccentric and flamboyant characters that are every bit as corny and fun as the evil dead.the action screams out its homage to the random gadgets and macgyver like use of surroundings in the 1970s tv series.the script is purposely terrible you can tell as schumacher picked out every one liner possible and made a script out of them.i honestly cant believe people took this seriously and to heart i think its better than both of burtons films which were also cheesy and over the top but with a far too serious tone but because tim burtons name was there no one will consider it bad.burton is extremely overrated because we all know it was jack nicholson who carried the 1989 film. overall its funny, it doesnt take itself seriously at all yet stubborn people without a sense of humour label it as an atrocity ive actually read that somewhere...sad.giving this a bad review because it was cheesy is like giving a bad review to evil dead, freddy vs jason, or mars attacks!.overall a perfect batman parody and a good homage to the awesomely cheesy 70s show all that was missing was a little pow! sock! whap!",positive
"it has ended 6 years ago and we still talk about it, i think that this shows us how fantastic this series was. there are some new programmes that are good, but any of them is half as interesting as seinfeld was. many of its episodes are really comedy masterpieces. after watching one of them you become an addict. the characters are fantastic, the actors performed so well that you cant think of them like anything but the character they played, maybe this is the reason because they couldnt success in other shows. the writers who could do 8 seasons of a show about nothing doing each episode funnier than the last one deserves our respect and admiration. to sum up, seinfeld rules",positive
i really cant describe my feelings after i saw this terrible thing. this thing and not movie because i cant say that it was a movie but a torture thing about how sick and disgusting a human mind can get that finds that this is entertaining and beautiful. i felt so sick and fury for this thing. i hope that the diractors in the future will have it as an example for unethical and inappropriate movie. i urge everyone that hasnt seen this thing erase it from your list and forget about its existence. i really cant understand how the actors and actresses agreed to participate for this.,negative
"all right guys, i literally never do this... in fact, i have never done this... but i absolutely hated this movie and i did not feel this way about the first two not even 10 minutes in and it was so wildly cringe i wanted to erase it from the face of the earth, let alone just my tv screen. it was this weird mix of a wannabe mel brooks movie, a soft core and an awful troma movie. honestly, it was just all around irritating with its incessant yelling and melodrama. the script was bad. the acting was bad. the concept was tired and silly. i thought that the warden did good as the doctor in the first movie, but this was just... insufferable. his delivery was... well, out of this world... quite literally. it was like an alien trying to poorly imitate the human inflection. it got to the point where it was almost incomprehensible. everything they were attempting to do with this movie stylistically was apparent... i understood the schtick and the vibe, but it was wildly unsuccessful. to be quite honest, to date, this is the worst movie ive seen. again, ive literally never said that. the only good part about this was inmate 297 just cause he was kinda hot lol also, as a side note, theres nothing cool about superfluously throwing around the n word for no apparent reason either. the only reason i finished this movie was because i think its unfair to write a review on a movie that you didnt complete... but dang...and the fact that i had to sit through this for almost 2 hours is an actual crime. all i can say is i hope they enjoyed the process and had fun on set. 1.5 rounding up to a 2 because... it was literally a completed film. thats it. would not recommend.",negative
"this is by far the worst movie ever!! critics call it imagine a movie made out of deleted scenes! thats the only one i know. the story? well who cares?! the movie is so bad, youll hardly notice it. the dialogue is atrocoius, and the actors acting is terrible. it even won 9 razzies! jlos performance proves that singers shouldnt act. just look at britney spears in crossroads, and beyonce knowes in austin powers 3. ben affleck is an okay actor, but this is not forgivable. not even al paccino or christopher walken can save this movie from going down the drain! gigli gets a very generous 1 out of 5.",negative
"need to say more? ouch! imdb says i need to say more, at least ten lines. 3. oh god! this film haunts me even in writing for a comment. 4. this movie has been an ordeal for me. 5. this movie is the worst of all . i cant put up with this. nooooooooooooooooooooooo. omg. i dont want to say anything anymore. please! can somebody help me. imdb should not impose rules of at least 10 lines with this movie because i cant even think of at least 10 words. oh my god. this is so crazy. oh my god. all i have to do is say meaningless and useless things. i think this makes ten lines already. got to submit it. im gonna try.",negative
"on first glance, one piece is not too different from other anime series. it has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired. but in its core, one piece is about something else its about nakama. nakama, a japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in one piece. stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. with you nakama, you can do anything. and it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group. it also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws in fact, all people do seemingly perfect swordsman and first mate roronoa zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on. but despite these flaws, they continue fighting. for each other and with each other. if one crewmember cant do it, somebody else will be right there for support. if youre looking for a funny, actionfilled series whose main characters easily grow to your heart and feel like family go for one piece. you will not regret it!",positive
"i watched i know who killed me on dvd only because i think lindsey lohan is a knockout and a pretty good actress. even georgia rules, with all its imperfections, had value to me. but ikwkm is completely worthless. lindsey lohans appearance and acting were both awful. she had so much garish makeup on she looked like she was playing kabuki. her hair seemed darkened with axle grease. her performance was stiff, even trancelike. also, the story was ridiculous to the point of being comical. the writer and director should have been dismembered, not the killers victims. the milieu was prurient, seamy, and exploitative. i felt like taking a shower after watching this movie to wash the grime off. i hope this promising young actress gets her act together and chooses better material. or perhaps her life choices limit the material offered to her. how sad.",positive
"this is a much needed action movie audience have been craving. just grab some popcorns and relax on a weekend night and have a blast. it is made to thrill the audience and full of suspence from the start. it is stylishly made with good colour gradient. the acting is great and story proceeds with good pacing, sometime too fast perhaps for some viewers. but it is enjoyable . brad pitt is star of the movie and captures the screen every time he is in the scene. one thing is for sure that it becomes rather predictable at times and viewers starts to have an idea wha is going to happen next. over all a good watch.",positive

"second season has those intimate, slowbuilding closeups that are made for the emmys. and i love that. jeremy is even better than in the first season, hes just such a great actor. i cant believe that it got better without exaggerating as they mostly do when a series was successful. not here. its still about the people and not about flexing. there are also more of those moments what it means to reach for the higher fruits which also helps for character development and building. i just want to be with these people because they all have their heart in the right place. sometimes it feels like this is ted lasso just more even swearing and about cooking. i hope the bear doesnt become a 6 seasoner, cause this will definitely become a multiple emmy winner this year.",positive
"several years ago, dc comics killed superman. four characters leapt to the forefront and claimed to be the fallen superman. steel was one of these characters and he showed great potential. then a movie was made bearing the same name. the movie sounded good in theory and it showed much potential. then someone casted shaq and the rest was history. other bad choices were made like casting judd nelson. on top of all that a director was chosen.... not oliver stone, not even tim burton, but kenneth johnson. kenneth who? the same kenneth johnson who did v, alien nation and the incredible hulk. it is no wonder the hiroshima of cinema was created. this movie is the exact opposite of what a good movie should be. bad acting, bad script, bad directing. this movie became something that would have made ed wood proud. the rest of us on the other hand should forget this movie was ever made. i know it is hard, but try...... please try to forget.",negative
"dont bother to try to change my opinion, i just dont like this movie. i didnt think it was funny, or entertaining, or anywhere near being worthy of all the accolades. why do people mention this movie in the same breath as hidden fortress or city lights? its obscene and insulting. this is no classic movie. this is just a stage musical in front of a camera. and why is that one dance number near the end so interminably long? musicals and nonmusicals should be kept separate from each other, as documentaries are not put in the same category with fictional or depicted nonfiction movies. if you want to like musicals, fine, but dont insist that i have to like them in order to appreciate film.",positive

"i originally watched this movie just to be able to say i have seen one of the worst films of all time i expected to watch half of it then get bored and turn it off but although this movie wasnt good it wasnt half as bad as i expected it to be. the acting unsurprisingly by paris hilton not even half as good looking as her character is meant to be in movie was terrible but i have to say i was relatively impressed with christine lakins the nottie performance who was miles above the rest of the crew and i was disappointed to see her resolving to a movie like this. i think that paris hilton should throw in the towel and discontinue her acting career as the 2 movies in which she has been the main character pledge this! and the hottie and the nottie are both in the imdb bottom 100 movies of all time ratings of 1.7 and 1.6. that should kind of send her the message that if she wants to continue being an actor shed be better suited to being an extra on a midday soap opera. overall the movie was slightly watchable but i think the only reason i was remotely entertained is because i thought it was going to be the worst movie of all time but there is worse such as the love guru, martians go home, the pink panther 2 and the appalling get smart by michael",negative

"theres a special category of films. the so bad its good category. films created with the best intentions that ended up so bad that they cross the line of their genres and move to the comedy section. well the room is the king of all these films. written, directed and produced by that alien life form our world known as tommy wiseau, the room tells the story of johnny a banker who loves his lisa so much and hes happy that has mark as his best friend. lisa by the way is an average looking chubby woman that in the rooms universe is hotter than megan fox. mark is a model looking man that will not hesitate throwing you off the roof and apologize some seconds later. theres also denny a neighborsonretarded weirdo that likes to watch people having sex. theres also claudette, lisas mother whos dying of breast cancer. other characters you ask? well we have chris r. who sells drugs to kids before getting paid, mike and michelle, two chocolate lovers i mean that literally, peter a psychologist who transforms into steven and a dog that looks like a frog. confused? dont be. everything makes sense in tommys mind. what make the room superior to all of the so bad its good films is the fact that its like the trailer said a riot. you see unlike other films that have 12 unintentionally funny scenes and the rest is a bore the room is a nonstop extravaganza. literally every scene has something wrong. every scene has one quote that will stay in your mind forever. because i forgot to mention that the room is also the most quotable film of all time. the godfather? pulp fiction? star wars? no. just no. the room beats the all. at the end the room is the worst and best film of all time. its a paradox film.",positive

"okay, ill cut to the chase. i wasnt very big on moana as while i loved its colorful animation and finding the concept to be pretty good, i found myself feeling disconnected with its themes and found the characters to be uninteresting to connect with. with this sequel, while its colorful animation remains high and there are some new concepts that i do appreciate like exploring some different cultural aspects within the world of moana i found myself having the same problems as the first one. for starters, disney once again provides wonderful character designs, sound designs, colors, and animation models as there are some gorgeous background colors. many of the voice performances are solid with their emotions and personalities expressed. regarding its writing, there are some new concepts i do appreciate and thought were pretty good, but unfortunately, it ends up being too simple that it ends feeling too safe and engaging to fully sink into the world of moana. i never really connected with the characters. dont get me wrong, the character of moana is definitely a good inspiration for children and i understand the creators intentions and their goals, however, i found most of the characters to be uninteresting or pretty annoying, particularly the character of maui who i cant really stand. the writing is bland as certain concepts could have been explored a bit differently but failed. as a musical, most of the music writing and singing are surprisingly pretty bad. many of the music notes and the lyrics are pretty bad and none of the music, unlike the first one, had much memorable scores. overall, disney sequels are rarely done well as they never really seemed to recapture the essence of what made the first one good. as much as disney is showing some improvements within this year, i found myself feeling that the real magic of disney is pretty much faded.",positive

"i have a problem with the reviewers complaining about how sheldon is such a brat and at the same time say they watch tbbt. if they watch that show then they must know sheldon is a brat. in this show, though, we have a 9 year old version of a bratty sheldon. in both cases he isnt bratty because hes spoiled or mean hearted. hes bratty because hes a genius and a social simpleton. thats the point. i iiked the show right off but i can also say that it has improved as these brief, less than 30 minute, episodes are able to develop the characters and relationships more. one reviewer complained about the lack of character development after only watching the first show! i also think the actor playing young sheldon is doing a great job. as with the adult sheldon the young sheldon is sincere, wants to be good, knows his own mind but also knows that he doesnt understand social norms and so listens to those close to him although he reserves the right to not accept those norms. i enjoy the family dynamic and the situations that arise because hes special. this family is much more realistic than the malcom in the middle family, a show one reviewer touted as being at a level this show couldnt come up to. the characters in mitm were ridiculously stupid. the characters in young sheldon each ha ve a unique personality and do things that you have seen others do or can imagine others doing, like sheldons brother trying chewing tobacco, repeatedly spitting it out in disgust then saying i must be doing something wrong. the writing warms the heart as we watch a family moving past disagreements and difficulties caused by their special sheldon all realizing that they love him and hes family which is more important than those disagreements and difficulties.",positive

"...to demand your money back. house of the dead is the most ridiculous movie ive ever had the pleasure of mocking. so much is wrong with this movie, i dont even know where to begin. these kids all go to an island for a rave, get there and the place has been ransacked and there are no people anywhere. is there one shred of concern for the missing partygoers by the latecomers? not a bit. as a matter of fact, when zombies start killing people off, theres even less concern. the performances of the young actors are flat and uninspiring, you dont have any sympathy for their plight. the main ghoul in the film doesnt even show up until the very end and what could have been an interesting plot is a ludicrous script with flashes of video game imagery and lots of firepower. the entire time the outnumbered partiers are racing about trying to escape this godforesaken flick, not one tear is shed or one genuine scream released. if zombies were chasing you, i think youd care just a wee bit more about the reality of your situation. one dramatic scene comes when the policewoman has her legs chewed off by zombies while the male lead is dragging her through a window. he offers a halfassed guilty speech on the uselessness of his lifesaving effort. maybe his performance falls on its face because the rest of the material is so sucky, but really the speech comes too late for anyone to care. do not spend any money to see this film. do not wait for it on cable because youll never get those 90 minutes of your life back. if you want to see an effective zombie flick, youre better off with 28 days later or one of the classics such as dawn of the dead. but take this stinker off your curiosity radar...destroy the urge and forget this title exists and youll lead a richer life. its a big, fat stinker.",negative

"the movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. it gives the basic summary of what is going on. this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is all you will learn about them. the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. i have never played the video game, but know people who have. from my understanding whether youve played the game or not this movie does not get any better. save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.",negative

"i have scarcely the words to express how much i had wished that the presence of reynolds, rhysdavies, statham and sobieski would have shielded the now proved tragically ephemeral majesty of the dungeon siege saga, from the influence of uwe boll. undefined characters, haphazardly thrown together for no apparent reason in randomly pieced together storytelling void of passion or heart, flailing aimlessly in and out of unchoreographed combat sequences with no apparent motivation, to a music score that seems as clueless about the plot as any other aspect of this movie. to cap it all off, some desperate unheard creative voice pollinated this putrifying corpse of a movie with surprisingly good special effects by comparison, perhaps in a last ditch effort to scrounge any scraps of production value. i made myself sit through this movie, and the sequel, start to finish, as i had done with the bloodrayne movie. i can honestly say i believe uwe boll neither glanced at the games, nor had the remotest intent to convey them in these works. in fact, if im perfectly honest i can find nothing in either movie to dissuade me from the conclusion that mr. boll created not only these two, but all his gamederived works, out of some malicious spite or searing hatred towards gamers and fantasy fans. i pity any actor that is forced to have their lifes work poisoned by this odious malcontent, and any story that must suffer the indignity and torture of being made into a lampshade in bolls personal buchenwald of film. unlike many others however, i would advise people watch at least as much of this film as they can stomach, to gain a deeper appreciation for the artistry of producing and directing a film. and, if for no other reason, as a warning. a warning that when stories as marvelous as the dungeon siege saga are brutalised and ravaged by mr. boll, silence.... is as bad as the crime.",negative

"la vite belle touches very deeply into the concept of meaning of life. its a study about seeing the beautiful side of the things, doesnt matter the nature of that thing. it looks like a hard theme to put in film, because its not that easy to convince the viewer to buy such theme. so director roberto benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in the holocaust. hardly someone would think in a good side of the holocaust, and certainly it hasnt any. but we can only cheer and appreciate what benigni tried to do. he dared a lot doing that. and benigni seems to be really the star in all aspects of this film. his acting was very impressive, it reminded me a bit of the jerry lewis performances, but it obviously has much more serious tons than the latter. being said, the entire cast did a very satisfying performance. the film scoreand the soundtrack in general is perhaps one of the most beautiful that ive heard in a film. really impressive. and so are the beautiful takes of the city. the scene where its raining at night and vito is escorting his princess to her home is a highlight. so, if you are planing to watch this film, do it. 8.410",positive
"there are two responses i get, without fail, every time i try to get someone new to watch this show. i dont like the art style, or ive seen the dub no thanks. im guilty of both of these myself. but if theres one thing i need to stress before even getting started on this review, its that the 4kids dub is not one piece. for the love of god, please do not think it is. if youve suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. they butchered it, theres really no other way to put it. they cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a much younger and apparently far less intelligent audience almost insultingly so, gave the characters ridiculous voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series. funimation has done a much better job so far from what ive seen, but regardless, watching it in its original japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go. as for the art style, its true, its completely different from almost anything else ive seen. much more cartoonish and maybe not what youd expect from an anime. despite that, you end up loving it. i wouldnt even say that you have to get used to it because its not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way. it didnt even take me two episodes before i was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything id experienced before. now, some 300 episodes later, i cant remember ever not liking it, or even why i would have. especially now with one piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful very sharp and wonderful to look at. now that weve got those two points out of the way... one piece is actually one of the best shows ive ever seen, anime or otherwise. the plot is pretty basic at first. monkey d. luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure one piece and become pirate king, and hes looking for a crew to sail with him. youll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as luffy finds them. theyre all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities. they form one very quirky crew thats always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams. each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and theyre just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the straw hat crew. not one character is left out or feels like theyre there for no reason. everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about one piece is that these purposes often resurface at later points in the series. no detail is left untouched, and youll seriously be amazed by the way oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses. the plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like i said, quickly evolves into something huge. much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though its definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the grand line, youre swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs youll ever watch. the battles and fights are wellpaced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely epic. but even through the action, one piece never quite loses its lighthearted, humorous edge. the episodes are sprinkled with plenty of funny moments, never too many and never too few. theres always a wonderful balance of action and humor. one piece also has its fair share of heartwrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! there are some extremely powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. ive definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. one piece has it all amazing characters, the neverending yet never too overthetop humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. and underneath everything, theres always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just being there for the rest of your crew when they need you of being nakama. in a word, one piece is perfect. and perhaps im just biased, being an obviously obsessed fan at this point, haha, but what can i say? its been running for 344 episodes so far and not once have i wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end. it is, simply put, amazing.",positive

"fast becoming infamous as one of the worst films ever made, disaster movie is a loose....very loose spoof of the disaster film genre. well, its more of a reference point for pop culture of 20072008. the laughing uncontrollably story focuses on a group of worthless, one dimensional heroes who band together to save the world from a mysterious apocalypse that has something to do with batman, indiana jones, the hulk, sex and the city, speed racer and alvin the chipmunks. we also get a whole lot of tasteless jokes concerning boobs, nearnaked people, sh, and blood. what does any of this have to do with disaster movies????!!!!!!!!!!!!! on top of all that, i find the humor directed towards women to be highly offensive and tasteless. whats funny about constantly referring to women as bitches? the cast is really hit and miss. carmen electra the poor mans leslie nielsen is very beautiful, but she has demonstrated a complete lack of acting talent. nicole parker is mildly amusing as enchanted princess but a little of it goes a long, looong, way. the rest of this miserable bunch is more or less the same. so, is it all bad? hell yes! but tony cox is amusing in a parody of indiana jones and the film is entertaining in a camp sort of way but other than that, this film is quite simply bad. so in the words of siskel ebert thumbs down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.",negative

"this is one of those films which just make me mad. why do movies like this gain the little success they do without deserving any of this? its because some people like it of course and... i really dont see how. the very first joke merely got a slight heh out of me, and the rest of it was just painful. the jokes are just bad upon worse, when they can even be called jokes. the rest of it are tons and tons of references to other movies. i wont even bother listing all the references and so called parodies this movie does, because my fingers would probably start bleeding from too much typing. no joke got a proper laugh out of me and no reference was funny. thats one of the many things this movie gets wrong, a reference is funny only when you put the right spin on it. nobody in the real world will laugh if i just say the word spider man. because i refer to a marvel superhero but say nothing funny about it. thats how most of the movies references work. the ones they try to make a parody out of are just ruined one way or another, and without a proper storyline with actual effort put into it, thats really all the film is hanging on. the film is terribly unfunny from start to finish and all i could think of while watching it, was make it stop. i feel insulted that i dont get money for publishing my according to several strangers enjoyable short stories in the internet, but the people behind this trash did millions upon millions of dollars. it is just wrong.",negative
im not joking. this movie is so bad that it took an entire month december 2021 to watch. its about kirk cameron and his huge forehead talking about how everything in christmas is related to jesus. he also says that a candy cane is a perverted symbol. you should watch this to experience how bad this is.,negative

if you liked twenty five twenty one then you will love twinkling watermelon. i went into this having a vague idea on what the synopsis was. however what i did not know is how hooked i would instantly be. its a good thing i started watching this on a friday rather than weekday as i wouldve had to call in sick. i binged watched all 16 episodes frisun...it was that good. i loved the whole leading and supporting cast. as i watch a lot of korean shows. i was already familiar with a lot of their other work which made this a wonderful reunion. tw is just beautiful in every way possible. not a lot of fantasy dramas are executed as wonderful as this series. its a beautiful roller coaster ride which will leave you wanting more and more. it was nostalgic and simply euphoric!!!,positive
"now, there can be no real doubt when you watch this movie that it is absolutely awful. bad as bad can be. because it is. so why oh why have you given it a score of three as opposed to a score of one or two? you might ask. well, the reason is that it is the most unintentionally hilarious movie that i have ever seen. it is listed as being an actioncomedyfantasy which would lead one to believe that it is meant to be funny. i saw the version in which the mighty arnold speaks for himself in his customary austrian brogue. i have not seen the dubbed version so i dont know how much of the comedic value the movie loses based on schwarzenegger and his dialogue being the funniest part of the movie. its the parts that are supposed to be serious that are the really funny bits of this movie. such as arnold regularly proclaiming with an even thicker austrian accent due to him not yet mastering the english language i am hercules. having a weightlifting contest with arnold stang and pushing over n.y taxis. im a huge schwarzenegger fan. i always have been. but the irony is that in the late1980s he felt the need to display range as an actor by trying to branch out from his heavyhitting actioners into comedy with movies such as twins and kindergarten cop but the fact of the matter is that arnold for all his trying was at his funniest right back at the start of his movie career. if you are a fan of arnold and love his inimitable manner of delivering lines. you need to see this. ignore the nonexistent plot and acting and just roll along on the river of cheese in a film that is so bad it is hilarious. three is a low score, yes. but when you consider that this movie should have a score of one you know that those additional points are on comedic merit alone.",negative
"shadow, the new adversary, is supposed to be sonics ultimate rivala vegeta for hedgehogs. but instead of bringing depth and intensity, hes as compelling as your annoying cousin showing up unannounced awkward, disruptive, and after 10 minutes, youre ready for him to leave. shadow had the potential to be the villain you love to hate, but he ends up like most poorly adapted video game charactersflat and outdated, like an old crt screen. the eggmangrandfather duo feels like the budget version of back to the future without the delorean. two mad scientists scheming with plans about as believable as a politician promising not to raise taxes. if jim carrey had returned to inject his signature chaotic energy, it could have been fun. but this is the sober, restrained version of eggman, and frankly, we prefer him unhinged. without that madness, the film lacks its signature spark. on the action front, its fastpaced and wellchoreographed but entirely predictable. its like playing sonic adventure on autopilotyou know exactly where its headed, and nothing surprises you. a few scenes stand out thanks to tails and his gadgets, but were far from the grand spectacle of an avengerslevel showdown. the fight sequences are fun but not jawdropping, leaving you with that it was fine feeling. we wanted a power boost, but all we got was a basic spin dash. the humor sticks to familyfriendly, disney channel territory. thankfully, it avoids fullon cringe, and a few moments will make you smile. sonic delivers some decent oneliners, but this isnt shreklevel humor that appeals to kids and adults alike. if youre under 10, youll giggle. if youre older, youll chuckle politely. the biggest letdown is the final duel between sonic and shadow, hyped as the ultimate showdown but executed with minimal intensity. we wanted emotional stakes, real rivalry, and memorable dialogue. instead, we get generic lines and a rushed ending that screams, lets wrap this up. the potential for greatness was there, but the writers took the easy way out. sonic 3 does its job. youll have a good time if you come in with low expectations. its like a frozen pizza satisfying in the moment, but youll forget the taste within an hour. worth a watch, but dont expect to revisit it often.",positive
"i just got done watching birdemic for the first time, i knew it was made on 10,000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. this same day i also watched the happening and the crawling eye mst3k version so maybe i was feeling masochistic. this movie was all around bad in every aspect. it looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and its obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. i know that because the sound is very awful, the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right, and theres way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. the worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices. the movie itself is very slow paced, the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. the problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters, not even vanilla more like tofu bland. we get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels, hybrid cars, global warming, and even the war in iraq as much as he can. the script is almost a love letter to al gore. this feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about, his obsession with a greener world, and his dates. the second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. lots of 2d computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. the couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van, this van has everything from handguns and two ak47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo im guessing the van has game genie, as well as medical supplies, and anything the plot requires. most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. the survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isnt the eagles we should be afraid of, its global warming and mankinds use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster. as far as the action goes, its about as lame as the trailer makes it look. when someone dies its just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. theres also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the moviewho wants their gas, which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. theres a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. at least companies like troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity, over the top gore, and comedy. the people behind birdemic have the worst cgi effects since the old star trek movies and long speeches about the environment. if you watch it, bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. other than that its duck hunt the movie.",negative

"oh, tom six. how i admire you. for all of the grief people give you over your films, it cannot be denied that you have a drive and ambition, and have been instrumental in bringing bodyhorror one of its most unique franchises of recent time. and i certainly cannot speak ill of the mans talents. the first two films in his infamous human centipede trilogy are oddly and undeniably solid pieces of cinema, with good, competent direction, wonderful visuals and even some great selfaware metahumor. i particularly admire the second film, which i find to be a tragically underrated and misunderstood piece of pitchblack satire. but unfortunately, it appears icarus may have flown too close to the sun during this third outing, as human centipede iii final sequence suffers a slew of issues and problems that hold it back as not only the worst film of the trilogy, but also one of the most disappointing horror and comedy films of recent memory. its honestly surprising how much of a stepdown the film is. the film follows prison warden bill boss and his assistant dwight butler played respectively by dieter laser and laurence r. harvey, who both portrayed villains in the previous films. boss is a violent, depraved, cannibalistic nutcase who believe extreme violence and torture are the only things that can keep his prison under control just wait till you see what he eats for lunch!, while dwight is a meek man forced to go along with all of his schemes. however, upon seeing the first two human centipede films on dvd, dwight hatches a plan to control the inmates put them all into one of the titular human centipedes which connect multiple people via a seamless digestive system by connecting the mouth of one to the anus of another to make them easier to control, and make them the ultimate deterrent to those who would otherwise consider a life of crime. while this is indeed an interestingenough setup for a climactic and insane finale, the fact is, the film crumbles under its own desire to be depraved and upthestakes presented in the first two films, all while also trying to do something new. the film reaches too far and stretches itself thin from the first moment to the anticlimactic finale. dont worry, i wont spoil anything, but i will say fans of the first two films will likely be let down by the final 15 minutes. actors overact madly, gore is thrown in by the bucketfull, language goes fullbore into nonstop profanity, the ick factor is piled on with taboo after taboo being broken... yet it feels so vapid because its so far overthetop it can no longer be identified as either horror or comedy. and as a result, the film becomes too cartoonish and thus feels shockingly tame in comparison to the previous two to be taken seriously in any way. even as a selfparodying comedy, which its clearly striving to be, its too much. particularly dieter laser... good lord, dieter. you were the best thing in the first film, yet in this third entry, you single handedly destroy the entire film with your scenery chewing. lasers bill boss is the jar jar binks of horror a cartoon that wouldnt appeal to anyone over the age of 5 due to nonstop silly antics. really, the only good things about this film to me were a humorous cameo by director tom six himself, and one brilliant joke revolving around whether or not the concept of a human centipede would violate a doctors hippocratic oath. im really disappointed by this film. i enjoyed the first and adored the second. and i do admire the intent behind this third film bringing the series even further into the realm of broad, perverse, satirical comedy. it just doesnt work because it doesnt know when to slow down or stop. i give it a 3 out of 10.",negative
"ashley tisdale does her absolute best but even she cant save this film from mediocrity. in this fifth instalment, slapstick runs rather dry and many, many gags outstay their welcome. hits like inception, black swan and mama are spoofed earning some healthy laughs but many dated cultural references and pop culture gags fall flat, this isnt as bad as the first two scary movie films but its certainly one of the weakest, reaching to the bottom of the barrel in desperation. scary movie sees young parents dan and jody raise their adopted nieces who have a twisted spirit overlooking them. jody begins to experience paranormal activity in their new home, and soon realises an evil dead demon is stalking them, jody must now venture to the cabin in the woods to find the book of the dead and stop the deadly curse, whilst dan focuses on his job at the ape research facility. the problem here is too many big films are being spoofed, from inception, black swan, mama, evil dead, paranormal activity, insidious, the cabin in the woods, even tyler perrys madea and fifty shades of grey. writers david zucker and pat proft cram it all in, the film is bursting at its seams with a lot of bad jokes and a feeling of desperation. the scenes where simon rex falls over whilst trying to set up the cameras drove me mental as it wasnt funny, the fight between dan and rosa, and the repetition of the cabin in the woods joke fizzled out quicker than you can say boring. the dancing mama and the apes talking about matt damon really killed hope, theres so much that falls flat, the fifty shades of grey scene was pointless and the inception scene really felt forced. however, the whole black swan sequences work superbly, the evil dead book scene was hilarious and the opening with charlie sheen and lindsay lohan ripping their personal lives maybe lousy but it works. erica ash is superb as kendra, j.p. manoux is very funny as pierre the ballet teacher, and molly shannon reels out some big laughs as a broken, alcoholic smoking professional dancer, there are some great jokes here, ashley tisdale is great at slapstick and she echoes an anna faris in the making, although faris cannot be beat when it comes to these films. the found footage aspects are decent, especially when exploring their new home, seeing jody smack the baby into the door frame, setting its head on fire then blasting fire extinguishers reign madness, its unapologetically poor humour but i chuckled. running in at under feature length, scary movie 5 feels long and exhausting, it tries to be something big but it really is just a squashed mixed bag labelled as a movie, and director malcolm d. lee does nothing to polish or let alone add craft to this tiresome spoof.",negative

"this started off as a brilliant show, very sharp and funny and fairly original. however once it gets past season 7 it really loses its way. us tv show makers seem incapable of allowing a show to end at its height. the idea that someone like sheldon, who most definitely has a behavioural disorder, can somehow learn to behave more lovingly is absurd. the same goes for amy. leonard and pennys relationship is part believable, and they do seem to finally get past his worship of her. howard and bernadette also seem to settle into a normal relationship. although with way too many stereotyped behaviours. rajs really character really is appalling. one step away from apu in the simpsons. and they get away with it due to the geeky guys being unaware of their behaviour?! meh. however the writing is sharp as a tack in seasons 16, and really there are some classic episodes. the one where sheldon is sick, the virtual presence device, the lookback episode with shell suits. but after season 7 it just gets lazy, formulaic and really run of the mill. the episodes that boost it are the professor proton ones. even stuart from the comic bookstore, who started out better than the main guys with women ends up being this gibberish idiot.",positive
"its always sunnys success comes from its uniquely edgy and different style of comedy. it achieves this through the brilliantly created group dynamic a group of shockingly selfserving and callous people to the point of murder of one another is casually dropped into conversation manage to create brilliant comedy, due to this fact. each character is developed so that they have their own unique comic selling point charlies uncomprehendingly disturbed psyche or dennis psychotic vanity and obsessive need for control or manipulation, for example. yet as a group the comic value is furthered as it is although, together, they are horrendously dysfunctional but also darkly harmonic at the same time. although saying all of this, i think the show does begin to show cracks in its original and edgy surface around season 8 and these cracks definitely become more noticeable throughout season 9. i think the shows commercial success has negative consequences for its style. this is because i think the shows selling point or reason for success might have been its fringe edginess which is achieved through the use of a low budget and focus on characterisation and natural dynamic and atmosphere. i think with the extra resources and money the writers may have steered in the wrong direction, which subsequently meant the comedy seemed more forced and the natural dynamic of the group less prevalent. although, nonetheless, a brilliant comedy well worth a watch. dont write it off right away though, once accustomed to the characters, the style of comedy hits home.",positive
"the righteous gemstones season 2 is like drinking a quart of red bull then finishing it off with a couple grey goose vodka shots. danny mcbride, john goodman, edi patterson and adam devine may not be truly loaded while filming, but the gags and punch lines in season 2 are so over the top and ridiculously funny it makes sense that it airs on a premium channel hbo. im fairly certain gemstones would be mercilessly censored on regular networks. and yet within the miasma of cringeworthy scenes, and certain lines of dialog that would make even andrew dice clay blush, there exists a palpable sweetness to the series. make no mistake the righteous gemstones is mcbrides masterfully dark comedy which focuses on the serious duplicity of evangelical prosperity, specifically, the hypocritical, money grabbing televangelists. season 1 was merely a warm up for this second season which, thus far, is a deep dive into who the gemstones are beneath the trappings of so much illgotten wealth and excess. season 2 is clearly character development time for the writers, and they definitely have exceeded expectations. no spoilers here as usual but i can reveal that season 2 was renewed after only 4 episodes of season 1 had aired.",positive

"what is wrong with this picture man? nothing personal to james as a director. i love his final destination series, but i think james is not the right person to direct this million plus dollars franchise. why james is hired to direct this movie in the first place? it is a big mistakes. like having ang lee directing the hulk. hiring an asian to direct an asian animation epic doesnt mean the movie will turn out great. the director must have a vision of the given materials. the entire outcome is a disaster and disappointment. it is understandable that the film isnt exactly the same as the original comic, but the characters and the plot just suck as a film on its own. from observing the promotion materials of dragonball, it seems that fox doesnt want to do this movie at all. the posters suck and the trailers suck. the studio spends a lot of money on making marvels and dc comics into movies, look how successful those films had become. the studios should pay more respect and faith in asian materials. to me this whole thing isnt making any sense at all because there are established fans across the globe, and dragonball comic and cartoon itself has last more than two decades. this is why i think 20th century fox was putting money into this project initially. everyone is looking forward to see a hollywood version of dragonball. soon as i saw the first teaser, i knew i shouldnt put up in any hope into this movie. even though i went to see the movie without any expectation, the movie still suck! despite the led down of the dragonball fans, it creates negative impulses to those who is new to dragonball. dragonball is a hot cult in asia and it hits the western market because of the stylistic action and fight sequences. however, the martial arts choreography in this movie is another led down. not to mention the screenplay, the production design of this film is not consistence at all. wardrobes, props to makeup, nothing fits together! not only nothing in this film resembles the original db, it is a disgrace. no wonder they use the word evolution. but when they say evolution, i dont expect the studio turns something respectable like dragonball into rubbish. ive seen a live action version of dragonball shot by the malaysian years ago. although it is an exact duplicate of the animation. but the movie is far better than dragonball evolution. a lot of us are looking for a remake of this movie.",negative
"i tried giving this show a shot. maybe a new fresh way of sheldon could be fun again, as when big bang theory first started and it was a bit nerdy and kind of fun. you know, before it became a soap opera with random references and no jokes. well young sheldon is more of that same recipe. random references maybe, sometimes, one episode we saw elon musk appear in the last scene, no jokes, and soap opera story line. i mean the latest episode i watched s01e07 where the premise of the whole episode is sheldons grandmother will not give sheldons father her recipe for brisket? i mean really? his grandmother is also portrayed in all episodes so far as being a full on asshole while from big bang theory all we got was that she was the most loving and amazing person in his family. anyway, no reason to devote your time to it, with so many tv shows available the last years, there is no reason to watch this one.",positive
"the new film, from director and screenwriter alex scharfman, is a horrorcomedy satire that works quite well at times and lacks more concrete emotions at others, making the film an uneven horror offering. with a cast that shines on screen as a great merit, where jenna ortega demonstrates the good moment she is going through, leading a cast where paul rudd is wonderful alongside a delirious will poulter, who steal the screen alongside ortega. the intelligence of its director when executing the script is a gratifying success, especially in the work of its characters and all the satire and dark humor that occupies between the lines, but it is not enough to round out a proposal that is limited by certain successes where it loses intensity when it tries to deliver something much deeper than what it needed. it has plenty of groundbreaking arguments to make it feel like a monster movie like the ones we saw in the 1980s, with brutal murders punctuated by sharp social dialogue and entertaining characters. however, it quickly becomes clear that the story doesnt have much to go on, and it becomes redundant and somewhat drawnout in its conclusion, even though the ending is a beautiful metaphor for love. along the way, we find a film that isnt bad by any stretch, but its also far from great by the end credits. a strange mix that has its moments of interest, but its outcome is highly dependent on the emotions it may generate in you and how willing you are to accept a lessthanpowerful satire, with certain special effects that take you a bit out of your depth. its an independent film from the a24 label, but it also has a grand ambition that goes beyond its own visual capabilities, leaving us with the feeling that it could have been much more than what we received, without being a disaster at all, but rather a decent film without much of a plot.",negative

"wow. what a rewarding experience. laapataa ladies is an amazing nostalgic trip to the days of basu chatterjee and hrishikesh mukherjees cinema of simplicity, morals, values and the common man. this is the kind of movie that makes its audience care for and invest in its characters. this is the kind of movie that makes its audience believe that there is goodness in the world. this is the kind of movie that makes its audience want to watch movies for its relevant and real content, its natural and realistic performances, its gentle lessons on morality and humanity with a drizzle of subtle humor. unfortunately this is also the kind of movie most audiences wont watch in theater because they consider it ott material. but this is the kind of movie that will make its audience come out of the theater with a smile on their face, a contented heart and a serene soul. this is what a small movie with a big heart really means. every aspect of the movie is stellar. the story is simple yet complex as it very delicately manages to comment upon multiple social issues without preaching about them. the humor is satirical but not sarcastic. the story is fresh and gives enough room for all its characters to breathe, take appropriate shape and find their respective arcs. each character has been written with care and given the required attention. the two titular laapataa ladies, the devastated husband in the village searching for his wife, his mother who has even forgotten what she really likes, his shy sister in law with a hidden talent that even she isnt aware of, the sour grandmother who also seeks a friend to talk to, the disillusioned but helpful manju mai at the station, the lovable chai serving kid chottu, the somewhat corrupt police officer with his simple minded but good hearted constable and the female constable who came through sports quota etc etc. all characters in the movie have been created with a lot of love and honesty and they have also been played brilliantly with an equal dose of love and honesty. ravi kishan as the police inspector is the only really well known name in the cast and he delivers a mighty and nuanced performance. nitanshi goel and pratibha ranta as the laapataa ladies showcase what natural and realistic acting should actually look and feel like. satendra soni is a somewhat familiar face but now he deserves his name to be remembered also. geeta agrawal sharma has rightfully become the goto actress for the good mother of a struggling, poor household role after great performances in 12th fail, omg2 and a small but nice appearance in fighter. sparsh shrivastava, chhaya kadam, rachana gupta, durgesh kumar and many others have given heartfelt performances that deserve attention and applause. it may seem like the world is overflowing with negative vibes, bad people, unfortunate situations but just like a lotus grows in muddy, murky waters, the inherent goodness and kindness that exists in people sparkles in laapataa ladies. this is something that cant be captured on camera with big budgets, bigger stars, flashy costumes, state of the art vfx etc. it requires heart and that is what laapataa ladies has in abundance. kudos to kiran rao for capturing the best and worst of human nature with such a delicate and warm touch. this is a movie that deserves to be experienced in its natural environment, a movie theater. it will not give you the adrenaline highs of a big budget blockbuster but that lovely smile on your face, that feeling of content and happiness that this movie gifts you will last much longer than you could ever expect. must watch cinema.",positive
"this is the original cartoon production for tv of a dr. seuss story by theodor seuss geisel. as with other dr. seuss cartoons and films, how the grinch stole christmas was based on a childrens book. geisel wrote that title in 1957, the same year that the cat in the hat was published. three geisel stories were made into cartoons that played with feature films during world war ii, and one was made in 1950. but the dr. seuss popularity, already well established by the books, began to soar with the longer tv animated specials. those began with this 26minute film in 1966. several more seuss shorts followed for halfhour tv showings in the 1970s and 1980s. by 2000, some dr. seuss stories would be made into feature films with varying amounts of real life actors and animation. this early tv film of the grinch is a favorite because of the voice of boris karloff. the famed hollywood star of fright and scifi films is the narrator and the voice of the grinch. geisel used just enough comedy in his stories to quell any fright that little ones might have from one or more of his grotesque looking characters.",positive

"some like it hot is the first of its kind. by that i mean that countless movies followed with the same plot men cant do something being men so they dress up as women only to fall for a dropdead gorgeous woman who just so happens to be really close with them. this movie however is the first to do this and does it in the best way possible. whats good about some like it hot is that it stays away from clichs and doesnt center around friendship and heartbreak, but moreso on the humor aspect of the movie. almost every scene in the movie keeps you watching and throws you in a hysterical fit. its a movie that shouldnt be overanalyzed, and should be watched solely for entertainment. jack lemon is brilliant in his oscarnominated performance as the witty and eccentric dephne, and plays his character with such convincing mannerism that we tend to forget its actually a man. in one hilarious and unforgettable scene, daphne convinces himself hes a woman by telling joe josephine tony curtis that hes never been happier because a millionaire proposed to him. it is both comical and original, showing that you can only pretend to be someone for so long. marilyn manroe costars as sugar, a sexy and beautiful alcoholic musician who falls for joes third identity, junior. this creates an even more comicgenius plot, having countless identities running around trying to stay in character. it definitely defines comedy brilliance. the whole concept of the story of some like it hot is complete comic material. this movie allowed the three main actors to really reach out and play around with their roles and to have fun while doing it. its not often that a movie features a lot of improvisation in order for the character to feel both real and staged. influencing countless movies, comedies and romantic dramas alike, some like it hot still stands as one of the best comedies of all time. and for a good reason.",positive
"only thing worth while seeing in this movie is rita volks boobs, the rest is a colossal waste of time! really i cant even see the need to write more about this movie, but since imdb is forcing me to, ill just tell you that if you even consider watching this movie you should just not do it. if you cant bother to write more then one line about the movie and have to go on babbling like a idiot for the rest of the review you know that watching this movie would only be a waste of time. really i would highly recommend choosing any other movie to see. i only saw this one because of rita volk being in it and heres to hoping she will never ever act in anything as bad ever again, so i dont have to see it. to sum up dont watch the movie unless you are brain dead.",positive
"troll 2 is basically just like other 80s horror movies like a nightmare on elm street and poltergeist only it has a truly entertaining campiness that makes those movies pale in comparison. the campiness comes from three things, the pi ss poor acting, the unconvincing dialog and the funny premise a family goes on vacation to a small town called nilboggoblin spelled backwards, where the locals, who look like humans at first, are actually vegetarian goblins that try to coax them into eating bizarre green food to make them into plants and then eat them. surprisingly, not everything in this movie is awful. the films isolated rural landscape creates a sense of dread and tension. you can see that the protagonists of this movie are truly alone, beyond the comforting reaches of civilization where anything can happen. also the masks worn by the goblin extras look genuinely scary. some of the characters in the movie are well casted, despite their incompetent acting. this includes the father and the little boy of the family on vacation and the little boys deceased grandfather, who warns him of what he and his family are getting into right from the start. what troll 2 does is take the boring old horror movie formula... 1someone notices something weird and sinister going on and no one believes himher. 2heshe proves the danger is real. 3they find some way to supposedly defeat the evil. stupid magicy good vs evil cr ap happens. they think the evil is defeated. 4fast forward a little and everyone thinks its happily ever after but then the evil force comes back and does something nasty. the film ends. and adds some fun to it with shoddy dialog and acting and a very silly plot and you end up with something a lot more fun than the average depressing, predictable horror film. also it is blessed with one of the most hilariously delivered lines in the history of cinema you cant pi ss on hospitality! i wont allow it! anyway, in the end, yes, troll 2 is still bad, so much so that its almost good but its not as hilarious as some crazy idiots make it out to be.",negative
"i thought the first hour of this film was ok. nice slow burn. and random characters added throughout as the possible intruder. sure the main characters do some stupid stuff to keep the plot moving forward, but for the most part i let it slide, because i was still entertained. the last 20 minutes however was just awful. i expected the movie to ramp up and get exciting with the mother son making the intruder wish hed picked another house ... but no, there was no fighting back. they both die and he leaves. and he was no one. they didnt even show his face, which was kind of stupid. make it the crazy neighbors husband or something. anything but the nothing you chose. also, hire some stunt peoplestunt doubles. i know the film was made on the cheap, but that 3rd act needed some actual action and there was nothing. they couldnt even smash a table or have someone falling down the stairs the basics. it was so dodgy. id recommend not watching. youll just be disappointed.",negative
"amazing movie... loved the storyline characters special mention for nitanshi goel ,an actress that i was not familiar with but put in a powerful showing of her emotions as phool, the way i felt pity for her and wanted to protect her the entire time and then felt proud of her in the last scene .. impressive! so i am sure we will see her in more mainstream movies in the future. ravi kishan puts in a very strong performance as manohar and really makes the audience stunned with the plight of his character and the unfair rigged system that he gets up against in the end. every character was amazing. definitely worth a watch for the whole family.",positive

"this movie is the crappiest movie ever. its boring, misdirected, has an awful camera work, as well as the worst choreography ever thanks to casting the actors 2 weeks before starting the production. acting sucks, cgi sucks, makeup sucks, the sex scene sucks the most of it all, god, what a random sex shot. i guess for uwe boll its not a great deal to actually lose a great part of his money producing films like these, and neither is for studios. i hope he doesnt get metal gear solid. i dont recommend watching even the poster, its so awful it made me tear blood.",negative

"wednesday 2022 is a series my wife and i finished this morning. the storyline follows wednesday addams being sent to the same super natural school her parents attended. a serial killer emerges in the woods around the school that fascinates wednesday. wednesday will need to balance a dirty word for her called friends, while trying to discover whom the serial killer is and discovering a mystery of her parents past... this series is directed by tim burton beetlejuice, james marshall into the badlands and gandja monteiro the chi. the cast includes jenna ortega scream, gwendoline christie game of thrones, riki lindhome the last house on the left, christina ricci the addams family, catherine zetajones chicago and luis guzmn traffic. the atmosphere for this picture was absolutely amazing. i was thoroughly impressed by jenna ortega as wednesday. she was amazing. her mannerisms and facial expressions were perfect. the settings were brilliant and have an obvious tim burton feel to them. adding wednesday to a school filled with other unique children gave the film a harry potter feel to it. i thoroughly enjoyed the diverse group of characters. the cgi used for the monsters and magic were perfect. the storyline was very clever in how it weaves in the past and present, keeps you guessing and tells you a little more about the addams family than you knew going in. the last 15 minutes did feel a little rushed, but i still enjoyed it. overall, this was better than i ever imagined going in. this is a series that needs a season 2 asap and is an absolute must see. i would score this a 9.510 and strongly recommend it.",positive
"i dont understand why this movie has to be very low in rating. but im just going to be one of the optimistic people telling people the good side of the movie. first lets start with my cons. nathaliayasmin is the singer or the girl who loves singing....welll supposely they would have found someones voice that matches the way she talks more if she cannot sing. including skylarchloe. but none of them use there real voice except janel parrishjade. if i made the movie i can easily find people who can sing very well and look great for bratz... another thing why does it have to take them 2 years until they get back together? it would have took just a month for the better? i mean friendship is awesome but no girl in real life would split up because they are in different cliques,clubs,sports, or interest. especially it cant take 2 years. okay let me explain the pros..... the movie is still good, the lesson is understandable....the lesson fits the point of the story, and is just a film that feels like an exciting girly movie. i enjoy this since i was a little girl. those cons i said on top, i mostly wished it didnt take 2 years for friendship to happen again.it would have been less plus the story would have been written better like.... meridith saw 4 girls having a strong friendship but she becomes friends with one of them and lie about how one another hate or say things about each other and make tricks. later on they find out and stop her.lesson would be dont be jealous or it would have just been a movie about competting against her in a competition and they try to learn how to work together and make plans to stay strong as a team. lesson would be stay strong, fight to win , or enjoy the competition, if you lost no big deal or another competition against dancing as a team or fashion just because thats what you always see in the animation. the music and the songs is great....no one should not deny that. i found it very funny how at the end meridith got embarrassed in her sweet 16th or her second one. i can relate to yasmin when she is sad and nervous. but is bad that the evil character easily persuade them to be separated just because she tells you to hang out in a certain group. but in real life no one tells you to hang out with people...that would cause a lot of chaos.",negative
"star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning im used to seeing spoofs where i know the films that are being parodied, but the recent crop of franchised, sanitised horror films have failed to catch my attention, so it was no help that i hardly even knew any of the films scary movie 5 was sending up. but know them or not, what cant be denied is what started out as an inspired, refreshing, if gross and thoroughly none pc idea got completely carried away with itself and just descended in to painfully unfunny dross. and so this fifth instalment, coming seven years after the last one, has an air of desperation about it, like some lazy studio executives thinking up something cheap and heartless for a quick buck. theyve certainly failed to provide something even vaguely resembling a coherent plot, and so scary movie 5, lacking the wayans brothers touch that got it started, is left to just drag on in to the wilderness. barely 70 minutes long, its hard to think how something so short could be so torturous, but as it drags along without the merest hint of a laugh as it does, it becomes even more of a painful slog to the end. im just glad i didnt really pay to see it. no stars",negative
"ok this is a direct with permission copy of uk ghosts, but like the office, translates well mostly to the us. its not ground breaking or falling of the lounge funny, but it is thoroughly enjoyable and easy to binge. the short 30 minute format works well and it feels a lot like a 1980s situational comedy, even having characters have set llcatchprases. hell it even gives homage to those comedies by referencing new heart. i am hooked, most of the characters are fun to watch, with their period idiosyncrasies and the nice easily resolved plot lines keep it going. the comedy is enjoyable, strangely relatable and inoffensive. thor and sas are the two chatacters that work least well for me. with sas the issue is he is from 16th c nat8ve american but speaks modern whereas the other characters speak in a way we would recognise for their time periods. i get hard to know how a 16th native american would speak without risk of being offensive, but it jars with the other characters. thors problem is his limited repertoire of catch phrases again very 80s comedy. they arent terrible but they arent as engaging, to me, as thevothers. though the episode of them watching a rediculous modern reality romance show was a lot of fun. they arent bad characters, i just think the writers dont know what to do with them. but thats minor issue. this show is a lot fun, easy to watch, bitesize comedy. in a crazy real world, its a great distraction. give it a go.",positive
"you can tell whoever made this wanted something big, something on the scale of a lord of the rings type film, but with some modern settings however, it fails. this is probably due to a lack of budget as most of the effects are none too good as the dinosaurs from the 1993 jurassic park look more alive. then again, as fake as the dragons look, they feel more real than the actors performances in this thing. i also get the feeling the makers just wanted to get to the rampaging as there are just so many characters relegated to seemingly important plot points but with no backstory! they just appear and do stuff to advance the plot and vanish like the wind! the story, two dragons need to eat one particular girl to become more powerful! one is evil and one is good. a news reporter sees something that triggers a flashback that triggers another flashback and we learn of the tragic and stupid tale. the reporter who is played by a guy that was probably voted most bland man of the year in 2007 then must find the girl who makes kristen stewart during her twilight run look oscar worthy and he must grab her by the arm and pull her as a big snake like dragon comes after them! we then get an attack on l. a. before going to the set of mortal kombat ii for the finish! the effects at time look okay, but even when it looks like all this awesome stuff is happening and there is devastation the buildings look absolutely fine underneath. it is like you see debris flying everywhere, but no actual damage. the acting is beyond subpar and as i said, so many characters popping up with virtually no story, like the doctor and the hypnosis which accomplished nothing. the movie had some entertaining moments within it, too bad they could not do a bit better with the technical stuff and get better actors. i am unclear why they chose to film this in l. a. rather than somewhere in korea, it would have been nice if the lead guy was not so useless as his former self was way more cool.",negative

this will probably be the worst movie i have had the misfortune to watch but thankfully it only took me 30 minutes to gather my senses and switch it off. at no level was this funny or interesting and the actors must be biting their bottom lips by agreeing to take part in such an awful production. 110 stars is generous and i find the high scores laughable and wondering if it might have been a better watch with my eyes closed. big miss if you can tempt your way to something remotely watchable.,negative

"i know that i will catch a lot of heat for saying this, but this is the only version of dr. seuss tale that you should bother to watch. thats because it closely follows the book with, of course, songs added for this christmas special and the moral of the original tale is preserved that the whos dont really need presents and they are truly filled with the christmas spirit. years ago, an abomination arrived in movie theaters and parents dutifully took their kids to see itand it was a total bastardization of the story. this time, the moral is completely changed and the whos are selfish jerks who are 100 commerciallyoriented and annoying!! and, to make things worse, since its only a short story, its horribly padded by allowing jim carrey to shamelessly overact. my advice is stick to the original! why is this original telling so great? well, much of it is because the quality of the animation is very good and chuck jones had a wonderfully devilish quality about the grinch that makes the character come to life. and, with the terrific voice talent of boris karloff who is perfect for the role, you cant help but love this rogue! for the special, seuss wrote some great songsparticularly the grinch song that was so perfectly sung by thurl ravenscroft. you cant help but adore this film from start to finishits about as wellmade as any christmas production and is a definite mustsee in my home. update when i wrote this in 2008, the other version was the hellishly bad jim carrey live action film. so, when i said that this cartoon is the only version to watch, i didnt know theyd one day make a cgi version that was actually quite good. is it as good as this cartoon? no way...but it is respectably good and is also well worth your time.",positive
"paddington in peru is an ok movie that could have been so much more due to its international setting but it the weakest of the three movies in my books. slow buildup in the first act does significant damage to the well crafted narrative of the movie. funny antics of our titular bear does save the grace but what takes the cake is the performance of antonio banderas who seems to have a ball with his character. the third act is the saving grace as the lovable family finally catches up in the majestic mountains of machu picchu and the inca civilization. however, i feel the audience were expecting more of silly adventure in the peruvian jungle and the amazon than it turned out to be.",positive
"time travel movies never disappointthat is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. what would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? its something to think about. i wont reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who havent seen it. lets just say that michael j. fox as marty mcfly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by marty threaten his very existence. he is aided by doc brown played brilliantly by christopher lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time. the movie is greatand i feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. in fact, i find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. it has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. all the actors involved in the movie play their parts great. anyone who watches this movie will love it.",positive

"if there ever were proof of the law of diminishing returns, the fourth entry in the jaws series is it. the original was a taut thriller that launched the career of one of hollywoods most celebrated directors. by comparison, michael caine often looks as if he is incredibly upset to be missing his award ceremony in order to appear in this piece. lance guest and mario van peebles frequently appear to be wishing to have better things to do, while lorraine gary frequently looks stoned in moments when she is supposed to look frightening. clearly, the budget spent on this film didnt go into the research, script, or mechanical shark. exactly why michael brody and his pals are putting what are apparently tracking devices on conch shells is never explained. perhaps any explanation they thought of was so incredibly stupid that they thought it best to give up. an alternate explanation of why michael is working in the water was never thought of, either. the true ed wood moment of the film comes towards the end of the piece, when the shark rises out of the water, and roars at elaine. this is the first time ive heard of sharks having vocal cords. given the box office draw this stinker had, i suspect it will be the last. the shark takes a real beating here, too. the reason the shark wasnt seen often in the original was because spielberg noticed that if one put it in front of the camera for long enough, the audience would notice that it doesnt move like a real shark. in this edition of the jaws story, not only do they keep the camera focused upon the shark for more than enough time for the audience to notice the models flaws, in so doing they make it crystal clear that this shark was made on the cheap. there are some shots in which the support structure of the shark is visible under the outer layer. there is even what appears to be a seam in the back of the sharks main fin. to its credit, jaws the revenge is wellphotographed. while the 2.351 frame is often sparsely populated, depth of field is used with great effect in several shots. the fact that even frames with one character in them wont make sense when cropped to fit analogue television is a credit to the director and cinematographer. if only this kind of workmanship could have been seen in other aspects of the film. another area where jaws the revenge deserves due credit is the score music. while the score is very much inspired by that which john williams provided for the original, it distinguishes itself and genuinely works in its own right. in fact, one could almost say that the score music is more than the rest of the film deserves. the music is literally able to inject dramatic tension into scenes that, by all rights granted under the accepted rules of filmmaking, really shouldnt have any. when all is said and done, i gave jaws the revenge a one out of ten. it works as a comedy in the sense that it is a stinking pile of crap, but there are precious few moments when the people making it seem privy to the fact. as a result, the film winds up in a class all of its own. its not just so bad its good, it is so utterly bad it is incredible.",negative
"a good mystery with a strong cast that checks all the classic whodunit boxes. the storytelling is engaging and kept me entertained most days i watched, with some clever twists and character moments throughout. that said, the show occasionally leans too heavily on exposition, slowing the momentum. a shorter, tighter 30minute episode format might have kept things snappier. still, a worthwhile watch for mystery lovers looking for something stylish and satisfying. despite the pacing, the plot holds up well and rewards patient viewers. great production value and a satisfying, classic mystery vib.",positive

"what...what is this? is it a comedy special? because it was miserable. is it a documentary? i mean...it wouldnt surprise me. is it a musical? yes. but also no? but also...maybe? is it genius? i think so, yeah. the best description of this i could come up with is that its like if pink floyds the wall was made today and turned into a comedy special instead of a film. and ill also say that ive seen some stuff thats felt extremely relevant in the big bad corona times. tiger king was there for all of us when we didnt really know what to do in the early days, i watched bojack horseman in the first few months of the pandemic and i dont think i need to explain how that felt at the time, i replayed dark souls for the 150th time and really appreciated how lonely it makes you feel even more, im thinking of ending things was a fantastic portrayal of loneliness too, and i even got into music and listened to the black parade, which feels like a reminder to enjoy life while youve got it. none of them, however, feel anywhere close to really capturing the essence of what it means to be isolated because of something you cant control as this does, and the fact that bo burnham did it all in one room and still came up with shots and editing more creative than most films with ten times the budget this probably had is just incredible. and the songs...holy crap, the songs. i cant say whether or not theyre all that impressive from a musical standpoint waiting for the official album release so im not distracted by the visuals but the lyrics are hilarious, meaningful and satirical, or really, really depressing at the drop of a hat, and while bo isnt exactly freddie mercury in terms of his singing voice, hes such a fearless performer that somehow, it all just works. whether hes acting or singing, it is always with such confidence and charisma that you just...go with it and let him take you on this voyage of emotions most people have been feeling since last year. and goddamn did i mention how brilliantly directed, shot, and edited this whole special is? i mean, i know i did, but im gonna do it again because im just so surprised at this being as good as it is. i saw what. around this time last year and didnt really think it was all that great, but now i really think i should give that another go because this was absolutely fantastic.",positive

"ha! this is hilarious. arnold schwarzenegger going by the name of strong on the titles, is the demigod son of zeus ernest graves and hes bored hanging around olympus keeping out of trouble. finally his father loses his temper, hurls a thunder bolt at him and he ends up down on earth befriending the weedy pretzie arnold stang doing a vaguely phil silvers impersonation and getting involved with some crooks who see his might as a meal ticket. what now ensues is just harmless, witless, fun with a confused mythology roman and greek names for the gods are interchangeable an olympus that looks like the herb garden of an english stately home and luckily arnie doesnt have to wrestle with ancient greek, just with 1970s english. there cant have been much budget so dont be looking for visual effects or a tangy script nope, none of that, just the future governor of california looking almost cherubic in his sprayon shorts demonstrating the truthful nature of the american dream. anyone can make it, however humble the beginnings.",negative
"!its really strange to me how every single part of the three dirty and inhumane films won several honored awards !!!!! im sorry for you ... just look at the movie. you see, in a few countries, the ban is forbidden the countries that have freedom of expression, and i think its right and you should not be allowed to play the whole world and be treated with the films agents. i read somewhere that movie director tom cutx is almost the day he did not receive email, call, or message of death to people, and was happy about this and said that then, its obvious that the movie has hit so much that you want to kill me! ive been horrified for horror genre films, and ive seen many of the films in this genre, and when i hear or read that, you can not see the movie as horrible as i can, but i really suggest that if one does not see this movie, i say, im sorry to see this movie, really a dirty and antihuman, trust me and do not see it. i know, unfortunately, when you say that you do not watch the movie, or do not do it, you can see the worse person, but in this case, im sure after seeing the film i was talking about you saying that i would listen to it ... i saw 2 parts and i did not see 3 and i would not see. if you see i took the time and i wrote this whole text for this, maybe even 1 person would not have bitter experience with my words. its okay, a brief summary of the film, for why i say i should not see the movie the name of the thirtysixth human film in which one human scientist hurts and savagely shoots it! yes sweetie !!!!!! thats the name of the movie is a thousand pence! so that the first person is the first person in the mouth and the second hip in the third persons mouth and ... and when the first person eats, the feces leave the last person, for example, the 15th! and ugly scenes ... horror genre films with supernatural themes, slasher and ... and i do not think the genre of this film is horrible.",negative
"anora oh, stay jealous, babe. stay jealous, honey. jealousy is a disease, remember that, diamond. im just gonna go chill in my mansion or whatever, you know, no big deal! this movie review is for my king sean baker for winning best picture for my movie of the year anora . i recently got the chance to watch this movie in the theater before watching the oscars and i couldnt have been more happy. i was smiling so big in the theater knowing this movie was so perfect. it truly makes me laugh but yet it has such a sad ending to it that makes you truly rethink the movie after you are done watching it. now here is my review, thank you sean baker for this beautiful film representing such underrated women ! anora is a film about a young sex worker ani from brooklynn, by getting her chance at her own cinderella story she finally believes she has made it. once the news that ivan and ani are married gets to russia, everything crumbles to the ground. anoras fairytale that she always wanted is now on the line with ivans parents bodyguards, igor and toros, they are trying to help ani discover the truth of what is going on without getting her more hurt then she already has. this film has made me cry, laugh, smile, and many more. even though this film just came out it truly is in my top 40 and will be there for a while. with so many strengths especially one with a deep meaning behind this film truly is a big one for me. let me go through the film from act one, this act really has tons of strengths, one being showing who ani is and not anora. ani is the sex worker in brooklyn with a sassy personality she knows what she wants and shell get it. with this mindset she can really do anything. she knows how to get things and how to make her people happy while also having fun and partying with ivan. this act shines a light on who ani is and not the girl outside of the sex club but the girl in the club. in this act i really love that you get to see anora while she is walking back to her apartment and see she really is just a normal girl and you shouldnt look at someone differently because of their place of work. act 2 really shifts and you see ani with anora coming out inside of her. you see her break when igor comes into the picture where he is trying to find that anora in her because he knows she was benign and didnt know how to tell her but knew he had to save her. truly such amazing acting was done by yura and i was so happy he was nominated because truly he played such a heartbreaking character with a sweet soul taking care of anora in mickey madisons ani. act 3 really shows the amazing acting within mickey and shows who anora is because truly thats who was breaking through the whole film. the ending broke me showing the moment where she stares at igor realizing her cinderella story is over and that all she was to him was a sex worker when deep down she is more than that. anora you are beautiful thank you. the character who i identify the most with is ofc anora. from someone who doesnt go by their first name and prefers going by her nickname, i know my true self adalina is more than who my nickname self is addy . like ani, i want to be looked at as this person because that is who i want to be and i dont want them to see the emotional and raw truth of my life through the way i act. but the real people in my life or the people who break me will get the anora out which makes you at the end of the day make you feel like you were just putting on this character and not ever being your real self. truly never seen another character who did it the same. sean baker my love thank you for the powerful message this film was making especially to the sex worker community truly this film put on such a huge message to them of how hard they work and truly all they want to do is be seen. they get used and beat down just because of their line of work but they are human too. this films message about being yourself and other things you do or did shouldnt define you really holds a place in my heart. while i finish this up i would like to say that this film is 100 4.55 clearly loved this movie and this does relate to culture around everything people have done for this line of work and truly trying to get them the rights they deserve. this film is so beautiful with the messaging and editing thank you to the king sean. also oscars just finished... mickey my love couldnt be more happy you won this award for best actress in a leading role you truly made anora your own. also a indie film being represented thank you.",positive

"this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. his characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script. the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison. unfortunately, sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. the majority of the films jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because hes too ugly and cant get women. the film is hard to watch too because it doesnt treat itself like a real film. sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the films low budget or questionable content. the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin sandlers career. pass this one up at the video store, i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.",negative

"great characters, slowly revealing background story, constant mishaps in odd jobs and fights over empty fridge. also amazing animation style that is sometimes deliberately overthetop but more often quite soberbutunique. its definitely worth a watch, and its just one season which is kinda sad but also reassuringly finite. the downsides, imo, are in the said slowly revealing story it unravels too slow, and in the end theres still not much. also closer to the end it gets more and more grim and serious which could be fine, but character relationships get down to a teenager emotional level, which makes it hard to relate to. still great overall.",positive
just how this piece of manure ever made it past the script stage is one of cinemas great mysteries. you actually feel embarrassed for the actors in this. one thing you have to credit the film company is was them allowing a 2 year old to write this piece of crud. if anyone actually laughed at any part of this then you have issues and probably laugh at trees. i remember seeing a film called men in white and as much as i could take of the shocking scary movie and thinking that they could never be beaten in the worst comedy ever category. this proved me wrong utter tripe,negative

"the star of this movie, daniel kblbck, took part in the first ever season of the german version of american idol. he managed to gain some popularity due to his androgynous look and quirky personality. he later took part in the german version of im a celebrity...get me out of here! and by now has faded into relative obscurity, but not before leaving us this tremendous achievement of bad movie making. the rough plot of this movie goes like this daniel is at the height of his popularity, giving large concerts and receiving dozens of fan letters every day. however, many others hate him and his music. his worst hater is a ridiculously edgy guy called balthasar, who is planning an assassination together with a teenage couple tom and rike. meanwhile, daniel is visited by a mysterious onearmed magician figure played by the director, ulli lommel, who tells him that in order to become a magician himself, there are several tests he will have to pass... now, where do we start? the beginning of the movie and several later scenes show daniel performing live, but his horrible singing, dancing and his ridiculous outfits quickly become hard to stomach. speaking of ridiculous outfits, i should mention that the evil killer balthasar wears a red leather trench coat and has upsidedown crosses branded on the back of his head!. judging from the bad image quality, lighting and constant shaking, the movie seems to have been largely filmed on a handheld camcorder. adding to the charm of the movie are some of the exciting locations kblbcks living room, the forest and meadow next to his house, a concert hall and the small apartment of the murderous conspirators. the production values are roughly comparable to the home movie project of a sixth grader. the true highlight of the movie however are the bizarre dialogues and the general ludicrous and nonsensical way the plot goes forward. its hard to describe and really has to be seen to be believed. overall, this might be the worst movie ive ever seen, but i cant say that i havent been somewhat entertained. if you want to take the dive and watch one of the titans of trash, i think you wouldnt regret it.",negative

"the texas chainsaw massacre the next generation 1994 zero stars starring renee zellweger, matthew mcconaughey, robert jacks, and tonie perensky directed and written by kim henkel. running time 86 minutes. rated r for bizarre violent and sexual content, and for strong language. by blake french the texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is so bad it is virtually mind numbing. it is the worst movie i have ever seen. even the most horrible of bad movies tower far above this romp that wonders between insipid concepts and horror free events. i have a real hard time excepting the fact that such badness can actually qualify as a mainstream film production. this picture is disturbing, bizarre, and god awful. i wish i could provide you with a more thought out opening paragraph, but what else can i say? there is absolutely zero character development in the texas chainsaw massacre the next generation. due to this, we really couldnt care less about what happens to the main characters. the films logic free story consists of several high school students becoming lost in the depth of a wooded area where they stumble upon a sickening family of psychopaths that put new meaning to the word dysfunctional. there are two deaths in the film, both of side characters. one is run over with a truck. the other has his neck broken. in a movie titled the texas chainsaw massacre the next generation, one would expect gory murders a plentythough that is far from reality in this case. there is no blood, no guts, and no chainsaw killings. the leatherface character does absolutely nothing in the film. excuse me. he does do something. he dresses up like a woman and shrieks his chainsaw above his head while screaming wildly. who are the villains? what do they want? what conceivable reasons do they have for living the lifestyle they inhabit? there are no answers provided. i am not necessarily stating that the majority of viewers will even care enough about the plot to even ask any questions. i am just backing up my theory of the terrible qualities this production contains. it is quite the surprise to witness some big names in the films cast list, such as renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughey. neither of the two are capable of rescuing the movie, nor are they able to perform with fine dramatic tension. what a complete waste of talent director and writer kim henkel constructs with this piece of trash. after screening the texas chainsaw massacre the next generation i honestly felt sick to my stomach. i love movies so much, but this socalled movie is a disgrace to all films associated with. it is so hard to understand what the individuals intentions were when they produced this heap of garbage. did the filmmakers desire to give movies a bad name? or did they actually believe the texas chainsaw massacre the next generation was worth a penny? after seeing this movies poster, and seeing the tagline still buzzing after all these years, i had a question for it. why is the series still buzzing when it ran out of fuel long before this film was made?",negative
"i saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so i have only myself to blame. but like most, i didnt believe all the negativity. being a sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. i figured it was just sandler haters. i couldnt have been more wrong. what we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. that is actually quite an accomplish. youd think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. but no, its just horrible. its not so bad its good, its just bad. you cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come. have you seen the movie the ring? where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? if this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play. you might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity. dont. please dont. trust me, im doing you a favor. there are 2 types of people in the world, those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those that have not yet seen it.",negative

"paddington is back, and hes still one of the most lovable characters to ever grace the screen. this third installment delivers plenty of charm, warmth, and heartjust as youd expect from the marmaladeloving bear. while it doesnt quite reach the emotional highs or tight storytelling of the first two films, its still a delightful adventure that fans will enjoy. the acting across the board is fantastic. ben whishaw continues to give paddington a voice full of innocence, curiosity, and quiet heroism. he is paddington at this point. the human cast also brings their agame, with hugh bonneville and the rest of the brown family grounding the film with sincerity and wit. the chemistry between everyone just feels right, even if the story itself gets a little more outlandish this time around. the new setting in peru offers some visually stunning moments and fun cultural twists, but the narrative does lose a bit of the tight, emotional storytelling that made paddington and paddington 2 such standouts. still, its a joy to see the bear in blue and red again, and he remains a shining example of kindness, decency, and the power of a good sandwich. its not the best of the trilogy, but its still a worthy entry that will leave you smiling.",positive

"star rating brilliant very good okay poor awful jack danny dyer is a middle aged dad of one, whose only outlet remains through organised ruckuses at football matches. after getting caught up in his latest scrap, a judge orders him to get his life back in order to avoid a prison sentence. over the coming weeks, he attempts to reconcile with his childhood love, dani stephanie leonidas, secure a construction job with danis dodgy dad geoff bell, and reconnect with his son, whose hit double figures. but his connection with the psychotic kenny boy callum mcnab threatens to derail it all. back in the good old days, when men had a ck and women had a sg... from the offset, its clear that the first collaboration between danny dyer and director nick love in well over a decade, somewhat unsurprisingly, isnt going to concern itself with any sense of political correctness. after all, who are either of them to disappoint their fan base, even in what are surely more sensitive, understanding times? but then, the film is an examination of a man whom time has passed by, and so its all the more fitting. the reunion of the directingstarring pair feels framed as a follow up to their signature piece, the football factory, despite featuring completely different characters in a completely new setting. in contrast to tffs flashy, frenetic approach to its characters, marching powder portrays an older, more beaten down man, more honestly shown as a desperate loser with little else in his life. the tone uneasily shifts between tongue in cheek humour and heavy, more reflective drama, without the most focused plot to keep you following to the end, but somehow it does. its a throwback reunion of old faces of the british crime genre, in front of the camera and behind it, rebelliously nonpc, messy and incoherent, but funny and wild, pleasing to those its aimed at.",negative
"sonic the hedgehog 3 is comfortably the best sonic film so far in a franchise that continues to grow. by adapting shadows story it takes this film to a whole new level emotionally and in its overall scale, enhanced by the watertight pacing that is suitably fast without ever rushing through the most important moments. its all held together by a great message revolving around how revenge shouldnt define you. pairing ben schwartz with idris elba and colleen oshaughnessey almost constantly works wonders to prevent him becoming as grating as before and they are generally a strong team. doubling the villains really does double the fun when it gives jim carrey twice as much screen time to get all the best laughs and keanu reeves brings all the necessary pain to every line he delivers as shadow. jeff fowlers direction levels up yet again thanks to action that is even more dynamic and how it really lets the emotional beats have the necessary impact. it all crescendos in the epic third act where it just goes and gives everyone something to do. this is easily the best score tom holkenborg has done for a sonic film, undoubtedly helped by the film itself going to darker and more emotional places which allows his music to go further.",positive
"i saw this movie last year with three friends on the saturday night of its opening weekend. every weekend we go to a movie and that weekend we picked i know who killed me because a fourth friend, whos a big simpsons fan, couldnt make it so we decided wed wait a week to see that movie so we can see it with him. the theaters filling for i know who killed me was moderate probably because lohan didnt actually promote it meaning on talk shows, she was rather in the news because of the then recent meltdown and because it was a rrated horror movie with a big blockbuster film opening on the same day the simpsons movie. that said, i dont think that this movie was that bad. im certainly not a fan of this movie nor would i purchase it, however it certainly wouldnt have been nominated for all those razzies if it wasnt for lohans disastrous period of time right before the films opening certainly they only gave two razzies for one category worst actress because off lohans meltdown, worst excuse for a horror movie wasnt even a category last year, and a screen couple with herself is ridiculous. personally, i think the worst movie of 2007 was norbit, closely followed by captivity and the number 23, then epic movie. i know who killed me is about a young woman named aubrey fleming played by lindsay lohan, a talented pianist and aspiring writer, disappears without a trace. then one night, a driver discovers a young woman by the side of the road, disheveled and critically injured. the girl is rushed to the hospital where aubreys parents, susan played by julia ormond and daniel played by neal mcdonough, wait by her side. when aubrey is finally able to speak, she shocks everyone by claiming to be a stripper named dakota moss. terrified and confused, she starts seeing visions of a figure slowly butchering his captive which later leads to a frantic hunt for the menace. i know who killed me was extremely weird, yes, and the acting was mediocre. there were some scary scenes and intense images. the plot wasnt amazing, but certainly more than torture porn and remember, its a horror movie, you dont expect an incredible plot line when you go see a horror movie. some say the ending was confusing, and i agree that it was, but i like that out of a thrillerhorror film it makes you think more about the mystery. a couple people on the board, just like many other movie boards, love to rant and say that this was the worst movie ever, but it definitely was not. the main reason why the movie did they way it did in the box office was because of the big blockbuster the simpsons movie releasing on the same day. in my opinion, to say this movie is the worst ever is really rather foolish because i cant forget these movies batman and robin 1997 with clooney, schwarzenegger, thurman 125 million budget battlefield earth 2000 with travolta, whitaker, pepper 75 million budget the adventures of pluto nash 2002 with murphy 100 million budget ballistic ecks vs. sever 2002 with liu and banderas 70 million budget gigli 2003 with affleck, lopez, pacino walken 54 million budget twisted 2004 with judd, jackson, garcia 50 million budget catwoman 2004 with berry, stone, bratt, conroy 100 million budget alone in the dark 2005 with slater 20 million budget material girls 2006 with the duff sisters unknown budget zoom 2006 with allen chase 35 million budget epic movie 2007 with coolidge hammond 20 million budget captivity 2007 with cuthbert unknown budget norbit 2007 with murphy 65 million budget the number 23 2007 with carrey madsen 30 million budget meet the spartans 2008 with electra davitian 30 million budget all of those movies budgets were larger than i know who killed me many of them over 6 times as large ikwkms budget was only 12 million, by the way yet i still would rather watch i know who killed me over them. go and rent this movie if youre curious about it, i know who killed me is an above average thriller, thats my opinion anyway.",negative
it explores the simplistic lifestyles lead by families living in the neighborhood and their unbreakable bond. the drama focuses on the lives and struggles of the children and parents alike and gives a lot of life lessons as well. a very nostalgia filled drama and has a lot of memorable and funny episodes in it. the characters and their actions are very realistic and theres great chemistry between the leads. easily one of my top 3 kdramas.,positive
"its taken me 3 attempts and i still cant bring myself to finish the movie. the casting is bad. the acting is bad. the plot is bad. the effects are bad. the shots are bad. the creeper is awful. the directing is abysmal. the only plus here is that it is better than jc3 although only just. and only because it has a select couple of scenes which grip you for a moment. jc3 had none. the jc franchise has enough ingredients to do something great again, but after these two films, it just makes the whole situation all the more sad. this was clearly just a paycheck for all involved. if there is to be any future to jc now, they need to scrap that this ever happened, go with a new studio and decent budget, with people who understand and love the movie and start again. sad sad sad.",negative

"to be honest when i saw the previews of this show with sudeikis running around looking like someone from a playground wanted poster acting like a caricature of an overly positive american that im not sure even totally exists i thought wow appletv is really bad haha, especially after some of their other major swing miss attempts. then i saw the 8.7 rating on here and thought wow they also spent a lot of cash to artificially raise the score. disgusting... but then i watched the first episode, even though i thought the ratings were bs i figured it was worth a shot since im a fan of sudeikis generally, and i have to admit i was wrong. this is one of the freshest shows ive seen in a long time, which is strange because it uses the same old tropes in a lot of ways but i guess its a combo of the characters and slightly new twists on the old formulas that make it work. its somehow chesey nostalgic but only in a positive way. for a somewhat broad comedy the acting is topnotch too, which makes sense if you look at the actors involved backgrounds but still, not what i would expect in a show like this, and i believe that is the other factor that sets this show apart from others like it. i never thought i would say this, but i highly recommend this show, and cant wait to see the next episode! ps i came in late, as the 1st season is almost over its been renewed for a 2nd already and i would say even though apple releases 1 per week, its best if you can save up and watch them all at once, since its a relatively light show imo its best enjoyed that way.",positive

"ive been watching toy story as long as i can remember and now its hard to imagine this great trilogy come to an end. toy story 3 delivers beyond what we were expecting. it has great comedy, wonderful performances by its allstar cast, probably one of the most emotional stories made by pixar, and a climax so suspenseful it makes the ending all the more emotional. toy story comes from an older generation of films. by now everyone who saw the films when they were younger is grown or just about grown. but it doesnt stop pixar. toy story was one of the first animated films i had ever seen. then toy story 2 came out and that film helped keep me fixated on toy story for a long time. now im older, but it doesnt stop me from loving toy story and its great sequels. in a way i think its the filmmakers saying goodbye to the older generation of kids who first saw toy story and the other great pixar films and welcoming a new generation. however you look at it there is still an obvious message in the film. and the message is simple but like all pixar movie messages are they are also smart especially the way its executed, but i think ill let you find out what it is on your own. the film is about andy leaving for college and now the toys are worried about their future. then one thing leads to another and they end up at sunnyside a daycare where they meet some new toys like the leader lotsohuggin bear and at first they think its great until they learn that they were put in the toddlers playroom. after being tortured by the kids they learn andy is looking for them so they decide to break out of there. however they learn that lotso isnt as nice as he seems. so now with time running short before andy leaves they have to break out and learn what it truly means to be a toy. i found this film to being darker than the previous toy story films. in the first film woody and buzz are afraid of being alone on the side of the road or being trapped in an evil kids house. in the second one woodys afraid of being sent to japan. but in this film the toys are afraid that theyre going to die. and the darker element i have to say is great. it helps build for a more suspenseful climax and shows that lotso is probably one of the most evil and insane villains created by pixar. especially since at first he seems nice and lovable but when he shows how cruel he is you know the toys are in trouble. and the darker element got me thinking about up and walle. both of those movies were pixars move out of their comfort zone. walle being a postapocalyptic film with a message about the future of the world if people dont change and up taking on serious elements like marriage, life, death, and learning to let go. and now toy story 3 does something different as well, it has a much darker tone for a pixar film which really works. there might be a couple scenes where younger kids might be scared but nothing that should terrify them beyond the point of seeing this film. and a little warning, this film is a tearjerker. the end practically had me tearing up and a couple times i felt a tear run down my cheek and i could see it in the faces of the rest of the audience as well. the film is meant to be bitter sweet. because of that tears are pretty much guaranteed. this film brings back some of the most beloved characters in filmmaking history and even brings back its audience from more than a decade ago. there are so many memories in the toy story films anyone who loved them when they were a kid cant help but see this film and shed a few tears for their old childhood friends. and who can blame them including me for doing so, pixar has proved time and time again that animated films are for more than just children and that the emotional aspects of the films can even be better than some of the best live action dramas that have ensured tears from their audience. my love for animation has proved to live on again in the new toy story film. ladies and gentlemen what we have here is sure to win the academy award for best animated film this year. i thought it wasnt possible but my high expectations were met when i saw toy story 3. it has beautiful animation, loving characters, a great and emotional story, and a finale fit for the toys who have enchanted our lives for more than a decade. toy story 3 is the best toy story from the trilogy and is yet another pixar masterpiece.",positive
"the good spoofs are rare and far between, sadly the starving games is not amongst the good spoofs, not even by a long shot. granted, i have not, nor will i, watch the hunger games, so i am not sure of how much in the starving games was actually a direct spoof on the events in the hunger games. but it hardly matters, because this movie failed on the most important aspect raising a laugh. i didnt laugh once throughout the entire movie. it was only when the bloopers were running that i was laughing. and as such, then the starving games was a failure and as far from entertaining as a movie almost could be. the acting itself was good enough, but people had very little to work with. and there were some great enough talents to the cast list, but ultimately no one really shined on the screen. it is as if the makers of these spoofs are way off chart, because spoofs are not what they used to be back in the days when hot shots, airplane! and the likes of those were out. the starving games gets a mere 3 out of 10 stars from me, given some of the talents in the movie, and the fact that there was actually some effort put into the production. but entertainmentwise and laughterwise, then the starving games failed miserably.",negative

"this is a cute movie. gross yes. slow at some points yes. predictable at other points yes. but it still works. its not an oscar worthy film. but its also not one that will make you leave the theater upset that you wasted your time which has been my experience way too much lately. it drags at some points and tries too hard to be gross at others, but for whatever reason it doesnt offend your senses too much say like a bruno. i think this is because after a slew of other gross, borderline slapstick movies, the modern moviegoer has become somewhat desensitized and can handle a little more shock. anyway, the acting is solid, the plot is kindof sketchy but not too much that its hard to follow or invest in. while watching it, you definitely have the feeling after a while that youve been transformed to the eighties era and as such, you might wish for the movies pace to speed up a bit. when it does, youre grateful and you forgive some of the more contrived elements of the plot. but what saves this film ultimately is the pleasant ending. so often these days moviemakers try to show their cleverness via creating a surprise ending with oftentimes a disappointing twist. this film has a twist, but its welcomed and it makes you smile and feel better about investing your time into watching the whole movie, slow, gross, contrived parts and all. this is a feelgood movie that will make you chuckle here and there and leave the theater with a corny smile on your face. so if you have a couple hours to spare on a lazy sunday afternoon, seeing this film would be an okay way to fulfill the down time. 6 out of 10",positive

"cheerful homage to the sword and sandal epics of the earlymid sixties with schwarzenegger appearing straightfaced in his film debut, opposite the neurotic, pained expressions of selfdescribed squirt stang as his unofficial minder. theres some fun action designed to showcase hercs superhuman strength and schwarzeneggers physique obviously intermixed with vision of zeus graves who bares more than a passing resemblance to frank thring who couldve also been perfect for the part lamenting the plight of his son whose been permitted to visit earth after he complains about the sedentary lifestyle on olympus. the clean jerk contest with mr world tony carroll was a highlight for me, building some semblance of tension as the mighty herc tries to elevate an impressive halftonne of steel in a televised strongman event as greedy gangsters watch on eager to convert hercs incredible strength into an ongoing racket. familiar supporting cast features james karen and richard herd in early career roles, whilst attractive theatre actress tanny mcdonald is effective playing the sarcastic juno, adorning the throne at zeus right arm, intermittently dropping disapproving remarks about herc of whom she is spiteful. light, fun entertainment which ive seen alternately with arnolds natural voice and with the painful dubbing, suffice to say neither is a masterpiece, although i personally found the undubbed version less irritating.",negative
"this show took everything that worked about it in season 1 and threw it out of the window in season 2. the comedy is barely there. there are still opportunities for laughs, but it seems like the writers have forgotten how to use them properly. the hair cutting scene, not funny. the slippers in the last episode, not funny. there were a few episodes this season that were completely irrelevant, like the christmas episode and beards night out. they didnt help move the plot forward or show character development in any way, so wasted. these characters worked as they were, we didnt need to see everyones backstory. there is very little sport now. everyones acting like a high schooler desperate for love. characters spend so many useless minutes chatting on their phones, because of course, we need to see the apple products. and as if the phones and laptops werent enough, we just needed to see roy biting into an apple ever so deliberately, so i guess the writers are now writing the plot based on how many apple related references they can cram into one episode. the acting is still pretty solid and i enjoy the technical aspects of the show. but the characters and the plot? completely wasted.",positive

"it is a classic british sitcom, one for the books. two brothers share a skimpy flat and their barelymakingitfromonedaytotheother existence, by selling dubious merchandise, goods that fell off the back of the lory and so on. the whole thing is kind of fine, because of the times, the environment, the idea that a man has to get by somehow. kindhearted small scale crooks, and endearing bits of life underneath a harsh appearance. what it lacks resistance when facing the time trial. only some can relate to those times and situations, fewer and fewer. others can still enjoy it, but i imagine only as an exotic comedy somehow. it seems like nowadays if one gets by like that, there is no question they are on the wrong side of the society, with little if no chance of redemption. back in the day, even good guys who were poor could get by like that, and still be innocentish. or so it seems... also, hard to watch, because seems like many aggressive businessmen of our days started out as delboy, but just made it, and lost all decency in the process. however, it is a legendary series, theme songs catchy, lovely characters, it is relatively consistent throughout the seasons. sullivan was really gifted, brought his life experiences into the shows. you may just get attached to his style and truly enjoy it.",positive

"charlie chaplins boldest film for its willingness to take on adolf hitler before nearly anyone else, the great dictator was also chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. if it had to be the end of cinemas greatest silent clown, he did what he could to take down historys greatest monster in the process. there are two reasons to like the great dictator. one is that chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his targets ambitions. the other is he didnt forget to make it funny. essentially a prince and the pauper remake, dictator presents chaplin as both adenoid hynkel, the cruel if inept phooey a. k. a. fhrer of tomainia, and a jewish world war i veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the common man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. while hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. the comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring chaplin as hynkel. hes simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hatechoked gobbledegook or subtle after shooting dead a man who claims to have perfected a bulletproof suit, hynkel simply turns and walks away with a threeword critique far from perfect. hynkel is a character who solves chaplins legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate herring billy gilbert or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator napaloni jack oakie rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. told by his righthand man garbitsch henry daniell that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs what more do they want? its from the finest lumber our mills can supply! the comedy around the barber gets more labored. maybe its because much of it turns on the oppression of the jews, though chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. its here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. there is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. at least chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. the famous last scene is a great divider for many in it chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? the world needs more love and less hate, i guess. its a philosophically strangled message, both antifascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when hitlers legions were swallowing europe, with chaplin warning of machine men with machine minds as if he was still making modern times and punching the sky at times for lame effect. to me its a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. if it doesnt transcend time as well as it could, the great dictator is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.",positive

"by 1936, charles chaplin was already an anachronism albeit, an anachronism who was also treasured as an artistic genius. the arrival of the jazz singer 1927 did little to curb the directors enthusiasm for silent cinema, and, though he considered at length the commercial implications of converting to synchronised sound, his first film in the talkie age was almost completely silent chaplin compromised by composing a musical score. nevertheless, the critical and commercial response to city lights 1931 was strong, reaffirming chaplins status as a cinematic master, and vindicating his decision to linger with an otherwise extinct medium. thus, modern times 1936 was to follow in the same mould, despite a synchronised soundtrack which includes a musical score, sound effects and several lines of spoken dialogue always spoken through a mechanical barrier, such as a recordplayer, radio or loudspeaker. the film is historically significant in that it was chaplins first overtly political work, raising concerns inspired both by the economic hardship of the great depression, and chaplins growing interest in socialism. the title modern times is used to deliberate ironic effect. traditionally, to be modern was to be at the forefront of human progress, a step forwards in mans noble attempt to assert his dominance over his environment in short, to further distinguish our species from the lower animals. yet chaplin believed that such widespread industrialisation was a step backwards for society. even from the opening shot, he draws comparisons between the hustling crowds of factory workers travelling to work, and a flock of sheep being herded through a corral. the dehumanisation caused by the workers monotonous factory work is played for maximum comedic effect, with chaplins tramp eventually driven to a nervous breakdown by frederick taylors apathetic brand of scientific management. in these conditions, direct human interaction is minimal, and almost always channelled through an mechanical mediator. in a scene predating orwells nineteeneighty four 1949, chaplin is reprimanded by a telescreen in the bathroom, the image of his boss looming overhead like the spectre of big brother. chaplin may also have been remarking upon the rise of the hollywood studio system, which by then employed a comparable assemblyline approach to filmmaking. chaplin, who was given full artistic control through his coownership of united artists, worked in complete opposition to these practices, though it could be argued that his perfectionism and often improvisational style was so inefficient that only an artist as wealthy as he could have gotten away with it. truth be told, theres nothing particularly distinguished about chaplins direction despite his strong reliance upon actions over words, his silent films were never as visually accomplished as that of murnau or lang, for example. however, his greatest talents as a filmmaker were concerned with the plight of people, and, however much sentimentality he liked to dish out, there can be no doubt that, in chaplins characters, one found individuals with whom they shared a very real human bond, of empathy and compassion. for all the directors criticism of modern society, he possessed a genuine belief in the value of human spirit. when chaplin came under fire for alleged communist sympathies in the late 1940s, the content of modern times was scrutinised for evidence to support the allegations. certainly, within the directors distaste for industrialisation one may discern an underlying dissatisfaction with capitalism, but chaplin was definitely not a communist after all, a prime motivation in his choosing to continue producing silent films was to retain his commercial popularity in foreignlanguage markets thats the capitalist spirit! nevertheless, chaplin was eerily prescient when he included a scene in which his tramp is falsely accused of being a communist, mirroring his own intense political troubles, which concluded in 1952 with the retraction of his us reentry visa. though he was initially hesitant about breaking his screen silence, as chaplins political convictions grew, so too did his desire to have himself heard. for that, he would, however reluctantly, have to embrace the technology of sound, and, for a mouthpiece, he would choose the most hated man in europe.",positive

"this is an extremely solid show. it is dark, but there are certainly moments that approach the limits of any sort of television style format. the ending of rick potion 9 is just amazing. likewise, the end of m. night shaym aliens. the strength of the show is just how amoral rick may be but there is a strong attachment to the many universes hypothesis within the show. philosophers have long debated the moral implications of many universes while realizing its a bit sophomoric and nerdy rick and morty picks at this as its stock in trade. morty is our avatar, and works in that capacity extremely well. the essential dyad at the center the title characters interact little with the more peripheral characters, who have mainly been used in b plots. this shifts of course, and with these sorts of shows they will always mix this for plot gain. theres a rich enough set of characters to provide ample space. the interaction between rick and morty hoists a bit from classic propaganda tropes without actually being propagandist a heck of a trick. it must be hard to calibrate this. the entire show is just chock full of nuggets and neither preaches nor deigns to condescend to the audience. pacing is always even and feels right. the writers know where to push and where not to. we will see how long this can be maintained. the writers show a gift for twisting addingto old plots into new shows. hopefully thats a stable arrangement. as an agent of chaos, rick should serve us for many years. there are actual ideas underneath all the humor, and heres to them. this might well be the best thing on television right now.",positive

"i think i know exactly what the majority of the people reading this interview are saying 510?? what the hell is going on here?! has this guy lost his mind???!! i admit, it was quite a difficult rating to give, and not one that i imagine will go down particularly well. but the unfortunate fact about this review is that i cant just look at the shows golden age when it was widely considered to be one of the funniest television shows ever created, cartoon or otherwise. nor can i talk about the almost inconceivable plummet in the shows standards over the past five or so years, though god knows i could talk about that for hours. i have to look at the whole series, from the very beginning to where we are now, and take the whole of the simpsons into account, from the ingenious hilarity of the past to the staggeringly awful quality we have today. first off, i should make it abundantly clear that to me, the simpsons, from season one right up until season ten, was one of the funniest television shows ever to air, past, present and i strongly believe future. creator matt groening, together with sam simon and james l. brooks, should be very proud of the work they achieved with them. these seasons are simply incredibly, painfully, blood vesselburstingly hilarious. blessed with an incredibly talented and naturally comedic cast, nearly all of whom have stayed committed to the show since its beginning, it has been host to a huge amount of characters who are all brilliantly funny in their own unique, very original way. the jokes range from silly slapstick, all the way through to sharply satirical, and everything in between, and they are nothing short of fantastic. the sheer amount of hilarious quotes and oneliners the simpsons has in these seasons is nearly unfathomable, and its not mystery as to why people all over the world can quote them so easily. truly, they have set the bar for not only television comedy, but comedy on a whole. as well as this though, it never lost sight of the threedimension of its characters. what makes it great is that we feel for all of them, and watching it, it never feels as though were watching a cartoon comedy, because it engrosses us in the stories of the people in it, and because there really is so much depth to the characters and the stories that concern them as well as excellent comedy that they almost feel like real people. this of course is especially in the case of the simpson family themselves, all of whom are excellent characters in these seasons, who have real emotional reactions and feelings, which makes their shortcomings all the more relatable. the ability of the cast to convey these emotions as well as the comedy is remarkable, and has led to some truly touching and poignant moments over the seasons. once we move past the end of the tenth season, there is a definite drop in the quality of the show, though not a drastic one. the jokes are a little less funny, the characters somewhat wasted, and the stories arent quite as intelligent and enjoyable as they used to be, however it is still excellent television and extremely funny. the cast are still as inspired as they always were, and despite the tragic loss of phil hartman by this time, which saw the loss of two excellent characters troy mcclure and lionel hutz among others, they are still displaying immense talent and understanding of an astronomical amount of characters. now, we come to the problem. the reason for the 510 rating. a truly heartbreaking moment in television history, because once we reach the fifteenth season, we see the standard of the simpsons has dived. and it has dived pretty deeply. from this point of the show to where it is today, its as if we are seeing a different show. the stories are moronic, the jokes are cringingly awful, exchanging intelligence and wit for silliness and humourless exclamations, and the characters are mutilated. the fact the animation has improved only emphasises the change, and all the gueststars and guest writers in the world cant salvage this shipwreck. the awful jokes and lack of good stories are bad enough, but the worst problem with the simpsons today, is that the characters have been ruined. all of them were once threedimensional, interesting and real, but they are all now nothing but background pictures, opportunities for jokes. and bad ones at that. my answer to the question that everyone asks about the simpsons is my favourite character other than homer is sideshow bob, but even one as hilarious as him cant seem to manage one good joke. the worst offence is of course ruining the simpsons themselves. it started early on with marge, who was given terrible jokes and pointless stories, and now has even spread to maggie, who is also stuck with uninteresting, unfunny stories. i dont fully understand how people can stop being funny. it doesnt sound like something that can just happen, but that is exactly what has happened to the writers of the simpsons. the show that was once groundbreaking and ingenious is now pathetic, a tired old dog limping to the grave that it should have reached years ago. i may sound bitter, and in truth i am, because this was a truly spectacular, oneofakind show, and now it will not be allowed to be put to rest. i love the simpsons. i love the characters, i love the casts performances and i love the stories. but that was quite a long time ago, when it deserved it. when it does eventually end, i will of course be extremely sad, but i will be more relieved that finally this great television programme can call it a day at last.",positive

"the transition from silent film to sound is undoubtedly the most significant change to affect the cinematic medium. the commercial success of 1927s the jazz singer, the first mainstream film to feature talking segments, prompted other studios to either add sound segments to already existing silent films, or create fulllength talkies. the public eagerly embraced this new form, but not all were so enthusiastic to abandon mute film. perhaps the most ardent promoter of silent cinema at this time was charlie chaplin. between 1928 and 1931, the number of silent features steadily dwindled until. in 1930 and 1931, hollywood produced maybe 4 silent pictures, among the hundreds of sound features that came out in those years. one of them was city lights 1931. if city lights as well as chaplins 1936 modern times serve as an epilogue or elegy for the silent era, it can also be said that chaplins film provides a passionate and effective argument for the aesthetic and emotional value of cinema without spoken dialogue. once again, chaplin uses his little tramp character in a tale that blends humor with pathos. the tramp makes the acquaintance of two very different characters a pretty, blind flower girl who lives in poverty stunningly played by virginia cherrill and an eccentric millionaire harry myers who only remembers the tramp when hes drunk. chaplin, who wrote and directed the film as usual, plays off of the contrast between rich and poor, and once again his tramp character shows humor and resilience in the face of adversity. when he realizes that the flower girl is in dire financial straits, he does everything possible to help her, and an unexpected love blossoms between the two. there are many funny scenes here the opening scene with the tramp sleeping on the statue as its unveiled, the tramp and the millionaire attempting to dance in the restaurant, the comical boxing match all displaying chaplins trademark command of visual humor. the flower girl is the emotional anchor of the movie happy despite her blindness and poverty, she takes in the tramp as well as the viewer with her incandescent charm. neither she nor the tramp have much materially, but their concern for each other illustrate how love can make every life better despite hardship. the acting is superb. chaplin could seemingly do no wrong on screen, and he shows humor, flamboyance, tenderness and warmth in his portrayal. the biggest revelation is virginia cherrill, in her first major film role. cherrill is wonderfully natural, understated and charming, beautiful and luminous, the center of all of her scenes. she convincingly portrays the blind girl and contributes a performance full of feeling. the interplay between cherrill and chaplin at the end of the movie is extraordinarily moving and memorable. harry myers is funny and memorable as the millionaire whom the tramp befriends. chaplin always employed a rather minimalistic style of cinematography as director. he didnt care to have the camera draw attention to itself, but used it to capture the story in a way that would emotionally involve the audience. chaplin also composed the score, and it effectively draws out the right emotions from each character and situation. overall, city lights is a definite classic. score 1010",positive

"i mean honestly, what were you expecting. its a film titled house of the dead. based on a video game thats already out of date. with a low budget and no name actors. i know my expectations came no where near the top with this one and i was decently suprised. is it a bad movie? oh yes. but its heart is in the right place. one thing for sure is that the filmmakers did a good job capturing the video games atmosphere. there are scenes incorpated into the film right from the game. as a long time game and genre fan i can appreciate the slight throwbacks to its core audience. the film doesnt really represent any one of the games although im quite sure it acts as a prequel to them. the same way the infintely better resident evil did. its about a supposed killer ravethat looks more like a ho down on a island where the people are suddenly attacked buy a weirdos zombie experiments and turned into food for the fast and ever growing undead population. the film really is nothing more than that. there are some cool but overused camera techniques. mostly stolen from other films but used in creative ways and some decent splatter fx accompanied with hilariously intentional and unintentional dialogue and scenes. plus alot of unnecessary gratious nudity. so once again was this film bad? yes. was it entertaining? damn right it was. its a gutsy, gory little action horror flick made specifically for the fun of it! and if you see it as anything else well than the joke is on you.",negative
"the movie is garbage. if youve seen any uwe boll flicks in the past, you know exactly what to expect. its not that the actors are bad per say most do what they can given the limitations of the terrible script but the whole film just reeks of bad editing and worst direction. its bad. really bad. almost bad enough to be considered a guilty pleasure just so you can writhe and cringe at how awful it is. granted, its not as bad as last years eragon, but dont expect anything close to what lord of the rings offered us in terms of epic fantasy adventure. oh, and those ten star reviews you keep reading? uwe boll has to be paying them. i cant imagine anyone out there even on the internet is that stupid to consider this a good movie.",negative

"tees maar khan bollywood is replete with examples of fetishes of film makers who closely associate these fetishes with the success of their films. the earliest example is that of film maker j omprakash who always wanted his movie titles to begin with a and in recent times we have the example of karan johar, who has a similar fetish with the letter k. farah khan, who began her career as a choreographer and quickly moved into the shoes of another khan choreographer saroj khan quickly won a lot of acclaim for her work and then decided to expand her role to include film direction. having got the boxoffice ringing with her first two ventures, main hoon na and om shanti om both of which had shah rukh khan playing the lead, she perhaps concluded that since both the films had three words, three is a lucky number for her. so soon after the success of the first two movies, she gave birth to triplets and her husband, an electronics engineer, shirish kunder and she floated a production house called threes company! she also perhaps knew that the presence of shah rukh khan in the first two movies was a big factor for the success of those movies, but because she was not having him in her next movie i will not go into the reasons for that here, she felt that the word khan appearing in the title would help. when she was finding it difficult to combine the word khan with her fetish for teen to get the title of her new movie, i presume a wellwisher perhaps told her that using a multiplication factor of ten would triple the chances of the movies success thus the word tees came into the title. the choice of the third word was relatively easy, since the phrase tees maar khan connoted a braggart and which was in tune with the character of the script itself. the next exercise was to find an inspiration for this tale and happily for her, that was also a three worded peter sellers starrer after the fox. also, perhaps other well wishers suggested to her that she must have as many ks as was possible in the film crew and therefore had her husband kunder work for the background music, write? the story, coproduce and write some of the lyrics. the star cast also had a number of ks akshay kumar, akshaye khanna, katrina kaif, sachin khedekar and special artistes like salman khan and anil kapoor! now about the movie itself. claiming to be a parody, it turns out to be a rather inane effort. several scenes of the movie looked utterly pedestrian both in conception and execution and the only saving grace is the performance of akshaye khanna in the role of an oscar hungry actor. of course, the review will not be complete without the mention of the much touted sheela ki jawaani number by katrina kaif but katrina with her innocent looks doesnt ooze with oomph despite the raunchy lyrics and the dance movements. i would rate munni badnaam from dabangg also choreographed by farah as a better song although the joke which i heard when i was coming out from the theatre was agar sheela ki jawaani pehle aati, to munni badnaam na hoti!",negative
"spy kids 4 is an improvement on 3, so it at least gets credit for that. unfortunately it is a rather bland adventure without the best acting, there are a couple of fun moments and children may enjoy. plot is average and the acting from the main kids was actually not bad, i thought. and i have to admit the talking robot dog played by the excellent ricky gervais did get a couple of laughs out of me. jessica alba also gave a fine performance and the villain was not too bad, despite his weird squeaky voice, and had a decent backstory. 410 below average childrens film, not particularly amazing in any category but its not horrendous.",positive

"netflix has a reputation for throwing money at movies, assembling a few bigname stars, and banking on sheer visibility to make their projects successful. but with this film, they must have been disappointed when they saw the final product. this one is a tough sit. the pacing feels disjointed, the characters lack depth, and its hard to pinpoint who the intended audience really is. its not quite a kids movie, yet the concept is far too outlandish and poorly executed to resonate with an adult audience. take, for instance, the allrobot fight scene featuring a liveaction chris prattits totally ridiculous, but not in a fun way. its one of those netflix movies where you shut the laptop bored, telling yourself, ill better go to bed early than watch this dull crap. to be honest i also didnt like the female lead at all. she is obviously in her midtwenties, at least she looks it, and is supposed to play a teenager? she is a woman, not a girl! why is she pretending to be a teenage girl, when she is a woman? is this some kind of bodyswitch comedy? i was seriously wainting for this plot twist to happen. i hated to spend time with her. i found her boring and flat. i am 100 sure i am not the only one with this problem. in the scenes with her little brother, who later on plays the most significant role, i thought she was his mother. so wait, you spend 300 million on a movie, but you dont test the female lead? anway, the story didnt interest me at all. the bad guys werent really bad, more goofy. there was nothing at stake. am i supposed to feel for some tin robots?",negative
"hats off to danny dyer for at least putting his heart and soul into this, but as a piece of cinema its poor, stereotypical and derivative of just about every other film he has been in and a few that he hasnt. jack is having a bit of a midlife crisis as he realises that hes nearer the end than the beginning and hasnt much to show for it. his wife dani stephanie leonidas reckons hes a waste of space and his daily regimen of lager and sniff isnt likely to change that anytime soon. a bit of routine football hooliganism sees him in front of a magistrate who gives him six weeks to get himself sorted out, else he is going to prison. can he wean himself off his old habits and try to be a better personhusbanddad? maybe nick love thinks that a constant stream of expletives makes for a good watch, but this was just puerile. theres not an hint of subtlety, no depth to the characterisation and without a doubt, the best bits are in the trails. jack is a thug with few likeable qualities, and the strength of the drama between him and his wife is thrown completely under the bus when an incident with their son arty dyer should have put an end to the whole thing, but somehow just gets forgotten as what passes for a plot marches on. the whole thing has a 1980s look to it attitudinally and aesthetically, and the occasional witty asides to the camera soon wear thin as we are presented with a slew of folks youd cross the road to avoid. there is some humour in the script, but nowhere near enough to sustain this for what seemed like a lot longer than 90 minutes. a definite victory for hype over substance, powdery or otherwise. sorry.",negative

"the writingdirecting team of friedberg and seltzer has released such movies as date movie, epic movie and meet the spartans. all of them were horrendous, but moderately successful in the box office. for the labor day weekend, they released their latest gem, disaster movie, in which they whipped up in a month. please note that this was a spoof film that went through the entire production, without ever seeing the movie, only the trailers. the plot is very simple. over the course of one evening, a group of twentysomethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events. a large problem with this is that there is no time for character development, and the viewer wouldnt care anyway due to the lack of stars in the movie. these events could be tornadoes, rabid chipmunks or just a random fistfight. i found it very difficult to believe that this movie was actually a true spoof on disaster movies and it is most likely to be spoofing movies from this summer. this movie doesnt even work as the traditional spoof movie does where it uses only one film, this movie much less interesting spoofs of movies that will be forgotten about in a few years, making this movie no longer relevant. they makers think they can get away with having some unoriginal character come on and off thirty seconds later. these include what if batman was an idiot, or if iron man was crushed by a cow, or if the hulk gets crushed by a cow. the material clearly isnt funny but its trying to be which is the most important factor for this movie to fail miserably. why have the same two actors play all of the parts, theyre not fooling anyone. this movie is truly awful and unwatchable, which is not something i can often say about the movies i see. there should be no excuse for a comedy to have more hip hop dance 4 sequences than laughs. i do not recommend this movie because it is an enormous waste of everyones time, except if youre writing up a review of it.",negative

"i actually saw this crap twice. i couldnt believe that it was as bad as i remembered after the first time, so i actually saw it again. im nearly gritting my teeth as i write this, because no, it wasnt as bad it was worse. i can usually enjoy even bad movies to some extent. i like bmovies. theyre relaxing and most of them amusing. bloodrayne, sadly, is neither. i found myself unconsciously trying to cover my eyes with my hand, feeling embarrassed and genuinely sorry for the cast and crew with the exception, of course, of uwe boll himself, who obviously likes this... i cant find a single redeeming feature in it. the story is ridiculous at best, and the costumes and wigs oh, the wigs... are made to match. the fight scenes are the worst ive seen not kidding. we get to see vampire hunters michael madsen and matthew davis femininely tripping into battle like confused, overgrown ballerinas, and a number of identical chest wounds spray blood like lawnsprinklers, while every single person involved including the wounded look like they just couldnt care less. i wanted to laugh, but just sat and stared in disbelief. all in all, my advice is dont watch it. go rent dear old plan 9 from outer space instead, because compared to this atrocity id give it the academy award. i myself will avoid the sequels with fiery passion, and send the following prayer to any higher power please make any company considering giving boll money for additional movies see reason! like one or more commentators before me, i only wish mystery science theater 3000 were still around. they could have done this 4 times over without ever repeating themselves...",negative

"another great tarantino film, though i do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. the climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. there isnt really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but tarantinos sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. its no pulp fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films ive seen in a while.",positive

the cast in this film have a really low level of acting quality and at no point did i feel this was going to change. coupled with the low budget plot and frankly poor camera work it leaves the viewer wishing they had one of the neuralyzers from men in black. despite being aware of the predictability of the slasher genre i really struggled to keep focused. there were moments when i actually questioned whether the cast have ever met before or practiced their lines more than once. unless you like love island style characters looking to make a quick buck i would stay well clear of watching this. i wish i had reviews first!,negative
"i cant think of another film where i was actually laughing over the inanimate title credits. as an old codger who always brings up the subtitles on anything he watches, i really did think there was something wrong with them here before the penny dropped. so i was on board with the humour straight away which continued with my first sight of graham chapman and terry gilliam as good king arthur and his trusty assistant patsy clipclopping their horseless way around the countryside trying to muster the future knights of the round table. eventually, but not before a titanic duel with the doesntknowwhenhesbeaten black knight, he succeeds in this and following a piece of divine, animated heavenly intervention, the merry band are tasked with finding the holy grail. on this waferthin premise, the pythons stitch together setpiece sketches of varying hilarity from arthurs encounter with some proletarian peasantry, a discussion of the relative migratory capabilities of the african and european swallow, and of course the groups standoff with the allpowerful knights who say ni. on the separate knights quests you can fairly easily trace the authorship of the pieces, as we see michael palins sir gawain the chaste unwilling rescue from a castle full of sirenlike comely nuns, john cleeses sir lancelot and his bullinachinashop rescue of what he thinks is a damsel in distress at a wedding and eric idles less than valorous mission as the the brave and bold sir robin. there are also the bonuses of gilliams sometimes vulgar animations and the late neil inness humorous songs. making a virtue of the necessity of an obviously low budget, by rarely filming interior shots, doubling and tripling up roleplaying from scene to scene and just the simple expediency of not wishing to pay for what youd think would be a casting essential of a group of horses, i laughed loud and often throughout the whole ninety minutes running time. yes, theres a little bit of casual sexism and one or two mildly stereotypical gay references too but these arent overoffensive in my view and didnt stop my enjoyment of what i saw. as a fan of the group, for me, it was just great to see them all getting along so well, riffing off each other and producing such a hilarious comedy in the process.",positive
"anyone going into this film would automatically assume it would suck. the other films in the movie franchise have been garbage. ladies and gentlemen, disaster movie is different. the film is so funny and spot on with the spoofs that i almost died from laughter. all the actors turn in near perfect parodies of their characters. i actually thought i was watching juno and her baby fight sarah jessica parker from sex and the city. the guy who played hancock could be a twin for will smith, that is how good he is. he channel the hancock character so well that i thought i was watching the hancock sequel. the film is so witty and on the spot with its comedy, it feels natural. so natural that there probably was no script. with a film like this, the joke write themselves. throw whatever story you want in because its the comedy here that works. on second thought, the story works too. its leap and bounds over films that have been oscar nominated. the story centres around these people and a crystal skull and some disaster that happens. everything about it works. the fight scenes are phenomenal. g. thang plays a character called calvin, he has a fight scene with a real life panda. or at least i thought it was a real life panda, the animatronics and special effects in this film will rival avatar, and it came out a year before it!!! take that james cameron. the fight between the two is so well choreographed that it makes jackie chan and his stunts look like childs play. the film has so many unexpected events. who knew that a meteorite would come crashing down on kim kardashian. i sure didnt. speaking of kim, she is more than just another pretty face. she was channeling something else here, i think she must have been in character for months before and after this film, because it is just too phenomenal. daniel day lewis should be offering her his oscar, thats how good she is. ike barinholtz, of madtv fame, pulls an eddie murphy and a mike myers, by playing multiple roles. his range is out of this world. who else could be able to pull off hellboy, batman, beowulf, a police officer and javier bardem look a like, and prince caspian. i can only think of one man...and that is ike barniholtz. i cant stop recommending this film. its what the movies and film and cinema is all about. i wish i could watch it everyday for the rest of my life. which is why im giving this the absolute best rating i can possibly give a film like this.",negative

"its always sunny in philadelphia is a show that may not appeal to everyone, due to its use of crude humor. it is however,to those who are not easily offended, just brilliant. the show centers around five people in philadelphia who own a bar and get themselves into sticky situations as a result of their personalities. the show is funny as it is primarily characterdriven, with the characters who are each extremely obnoxious, rude and selfcentered in their own way. the characters instantly frustrate and annoy anyone who comes near them, as well as trying to manipulate each other to do things for their own selfish purposes. these interactions with other people are often the funniest part of the show. when people are around them they find themselves essentially shut out of the conversation, as though the cast is in a different dimension, and end up extremely frustrated by the situation they have found themselves in. the dialogue is also extremely good, focusing on the relatively mundane and the crazy simultaneously. my reference to that would be the power bottom scene where they discuss the positions in a homosexual relationship. the comparison of its always sunny to another good comedy seinfeld is apt but its always sunny edges out the juggernaut of comedy on its characters, as seinfelds characters are always at least a little bit likable. you at no stage should find its always sunny in philadelphias characters likable as they have no shred of human decency. and that is what is quintessentially at the heart of this show and produces the comedy, which was also the case for seinfeld. its always sunny is one of the great comedies, but not for the easily offended.",positive

"this film is just a mess. i hope that the intention behind this was to make some easy cash. otherwise, i just cant explain why would anyone get involved in this. there are outlines of a story, but not like an actual screenplay. the time setting makes no sense, the world building that is done through onscreen text doesnt seem to mean anything. the science is messed up beyond even the lowest fiction standards of science fiction. i think i had a general understanding of what was supposed to be going on, but im not sure. at times it felt almost like a bad parody, and i hope they were just trolling the viewers with just how much they can get away with. it looks like a fan film shot on a good camera with good actors but nobody cared one bit. i cant really bash on the actors, everyone needs some cash, there were a couple of recognizable faces like frank grillo who isnt a pro actor, but hes always likable, lochlyn munro, even costas mandylor from the saw series...this is just...bizarre. willis delivered his basic nearlycoma performance which he does in most of his fast paycheckoriented films now, and he made sure that the contract mentioned him in the script as an ultimate badass. his appearance was obviously agreed on only to have his face mentioned in the promotion materials. i usually endorse lowbudget scifi when i see a spark of an idea or actual care put into one. this is an absolute waste of time, i strongly recommend everyone to skip this.",positive

"in the vast landscape of contemporary television, few shows manage to capture the essence of modernday power struggles and familial conflict with as much eloquence and intensity as hbos succession. at the heart of succession lies the roy family, a media conglomerate dynasty grappling with the complexities of succession, power, and identity. logan roy, the patriarch, portrayed with commanding gravitas by brian cox, is a modernday king lear, his presence both formidable and deeply flawed. the dynamics among his childreneach vying for his approval and control of the empireform the crux of the series dramatic tension. among these captivating characters, shiv, played by sarah snook, emerges as my personal favourite. shiv is a character of remarkable depth and complexity. she is intelligent, ambitious, and fiercely independent, yet her vulnerabilities and internal conflicts make her profoundly human. her journey through the series is a mesmerizing blend of strength and fragility, as she navigates the treacherous waters of family loyalty and personal ambition. shivs evolutionor lack of is a testament to the shows unparalleled writing and character development. her presence is magnetic, and snooks portrayal brings a nuanced performance that captures the essence of a woman caught between the expectations of her powerful family and her own desires. shivs struggle for recognition and power within the patriarchal confines of the roy family is both heartbreaking and inspiring. her ambition is palpable, yet it is tempered by moments of doubt and introspection that make her journey incredibly relatable and compelling. succession thrives on its ability to weave a narrative that feels both grand and intimate. the shows writing is nothing short of poetic, echoing the timeless themes of shakespearean drama. the dialogue is sharp, witty, and laden with subtext, each line delivered with the weight of unspoken histories and future betrayals. the interactions between characters are a dance of power, with every gesture and glance charged with significance. the shows visual and auditory elements further enhance its storytelling. the cinematography captures the stark contrasts of the roys worldopulence and isolation, power and vulnerability. the score, composed by nicholas britell, is a hauntingly beautiful accompaniment that underscores the series dramatic beats with a sense of foreboding and melancholy. succession is not just a show about a powerful family it is a mirror reflecting the darker facets of contemporary society. it explores the corrupting influence of power, the moral compromises made in its pursuit, and the human cost of ambition. the roy familys world is a dystopian landscape where loyalty is conditional, and love is often overshadowed by the relentless quest for control. yet, amidst this bleakness, there are moments of profound humanityglimpses of vulnerability, regret, and genuine connection that make the characters deeply relatable. the shows genius lies in its ability to balance these elements, creating a narrative that is both grandiose and deeply personal. each episode unfolds like a carefully constructed play, with every scene meticulously designed to build tension and reveal character. the writing, direction, and performances coalesce to create a viewing experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant. in the pantheon of 21stcentury television, succession stands as a shining achievement. it is a show that dares to delve into the complexities of power and family with an unflinching gaze, offering a portrayal that is both uncomfortably honest and exquisitely crafted. with characters like shiv, logan, roman and logan leading the charge, succession transcends the conventions of traditional drama, presenting a narrative that is as timeless as it is contemporary. in conclusion, succession is a tour de forcea shakespearean dystopia brought to life with breathtaking artistry. it is a show that challenges, captivates, and ultimately leaves an indelible mark on the landscape of modern television.",positive

"what would you do if you could be a superhero? what if you have no choice? from the very beginning, spiderman into the spicerverse is very energetic and captures your attention. this animated film has impressive visuals. the music creates a fantastic rhythm. and you just want to watch more. the story follows a high school student named miles morales, who just changed school. he goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. ever since that day, miles starts sticking to everything he touches. then, he meets spiderman peter parker, teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain kingoin. the story is very original and makes the impossible possible. it takes all the abilities of spiderman to far and beyond with its action scenes. the film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. i love the nontraditional characters and how they embrace diversity. and yes! spiderman is latino and surely does speak spanish! there are also some fun new characters. with this film, marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. of course, it celebrates spiderman and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. it is absolutely eyepoppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. there are several different forms of animation in one film. you feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life. naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius stan lee. i feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. the result is a mustsee family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. i also love how this film is animated. its so different. ive never seen a film like this one. i think its very unique. be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end. this film sets a new era in animated movies. i recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. i give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my oscar predictions as a very possible winner. this is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways. with great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. this is the idea behind spiderman into the spiderverse inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life. reviewed by zoe c., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",positive

"being inaugurated as a new pope in the last century must have been a source of enormous pride. but there must also have been a nagging thought... at some point you are going to be paraded, stiff as a board, around your work courtyard before being taken back inside to your place of work and buried there! all that changed in 2013 when pope benedict xvi resigned, the first pope to voluntarily do so since pope celestine v in 1294. pope gregory xii also resigned in 1415, but he was effectively forced to. this movie tells the story of that curious situation, when cardinal jorge bergoglio played by jonathan pryce ended up as pope francis while benedict anthony hopkins was still alive. the official reason for the popes resignation appears to have been his advanced age. but the film paints a rather different picture. the movie starts back in 2005 as we enter the papal conclave. benedict cardinal ratzinger, as was is the highlypolitical german cardinal who desperately wants the papacy bergoglio is the highly respected argentinian cardinal who doesnt seek the office but might have it thrust upon him. clearly, when the white smoke clears, history has dictated the outcome. but flash forward to 2013 and bergoglio will get another bite of the cherry. is he worthy of the role? through flashbacks we return to perns unsettling rule over argentina and the events that made the man. the two stars are simply outstanding together, and its no surprise at all that both have been nominated in the oscar acting categories. they are almost joint leads. but perhaps to give the film its best awardsseason shot pryce is down for best actor and hopkins is down for best supporting actor. anthony hopkins in particular for me shone with the brilliant quietness and subtle facial movements that are the mark of a truly confident actor. less is more. i was enjoying this movie enormously up until we flashed back to the argentinian subplot. set in the time of perns dirty war when a huge number of people estimates range from 9,000 to 30,000 simply went missing. theres nothing wrong with this sequence of the film. for example, a reunion of bergoglio with a persecuted priest, father jalics lisandro fiks is brilliantly and movingly done. its just that for me it seemed so disjointed. it was jarring to switch from this evitaera drama to the gentle drama of the papal plot. if the movie had been 30 minutes shorter and focused on the mental struggles of benedict i would have preferred it. curiously we dont really get to fully understand his divergence from the faith. bergoglio gets no end of backstory. but ratzingers is probably just as interesting, but not explored. this is still a really fine movie and will appeal to older folks who like a story rich with character acting and not heavy on the action or special effects. the director is fernando meirelles who interestingly directed the rio olympics opening ceremony! and its written by anthony mccarten, the man behind the screenplays for the theory of everything, darkest hour and bohemian rhapsody. you may still be able to find this in selected cinemas e.g. curzon but it is also streaming on netflix, which is where i had to watch it. for the full graphical review, please check out one manns movies on the web or facebook. thanks.",positive
"i have been a faithful fan of the polish 365 series and i have read books one and two still waiting for book three to be translated into english... october 6th i believe?. this was the first of the three films to disappoint me. dont get me wrong...there are gorgeous lush lavish sets, a great soundtrack, lots of eye candy for both sexes, and well plenty of sex. what it didnt have, that the other two films did, was a plot and an ending. nothing really happens in this film. laura doesnt choose between massimo and nacho, her fashion business is left midway, olga doesnt get married and massimo never deals with the loss of their child. i felt like the first film roughly stayed true to book one, the second film veered off of the book fairly significantly...but it was kind of understandable in that they only have so much time to tell the story. i guess what i am saying is the second film still worked...i do feel like laura comes off better in the films than she does in the books. we start film three almost where film two left off, massimo threatens nachos family for what they have done, laura recovers and goes to work in her fashion house, olga continues to plan her wedding, things are strained between massimo and laura because they havent talked about her time with nacho or the loss of their baby. laura and olga behave like their usual drunk, petulant selves that are never satisfied and laura continues to dream about having sex with nacho. that is pretty much the entire film...no plot and no progression of the storyline. movies generally arent a choose your own ending story but this one really leaves you hanging and for that i cant give it the high ratings that i have given the other films. it was sexy yes, massimo and nacho are both still major hotties...but i do grow weary of watching these two girls drink like lushes and behave like small children. i still would like to see more smoldering content, so to be encouraging i am giving this film a 7 star rating.",negative

umm u cannot expect much from the movie. it is only masala. n if your a ranveer singh n arjun kapoor fan then a must watch. it revolves around the olden times off coal smuggling. bikram n bala the heros r brothers n how they become calcuttas dons is the story n then comes irrfan the cop. irrfan has done a good job. how priyanka comes in between bikram n bala is the story. it a fun filled movie with small twists. the songs not all that pleasing but are average. the locations were ok n the screenplay was good. the movie was taken out well n it is no harm in watching if u r a fan of 6pacs. so if u feel u want to just enjoy n pass your time u can go for the movie. nothing actually stands out in the movie other than the heros 6pac.,negative
"around the time gremlins came out, many ripoffs came out, and this was without a doubt the worst of them. in this film, a night security guard watching some random warehouse doesnt listen to the senior guard and accidentally releases some poor looking, catlike, puppet hobgoblins. they make peoples fantasies come true, then kill them. everything about this movie is just horrible. the characters are really dumb, and extremely clichd. one particularly brainless scene consists of a girlfriend getting mad at her man because he lost at a garden tool battle to a man back from the army. another very brainless scene has a man sitting in his car while his date tried to shove it down a cliff, and he just sits there like a moron. any line or scene in the film that is meant to be funny, ends up getting less laughs than the scary scenes, which involve teens holding stuffed animals to their faces. youll probably enjoy this as a bad comedy, but as a movie, this is really bad. my rating bomb. 91 mins. rated r for sex and violence.",negative

"say, for a 100k production budget, rhys frakewaterfield made a bmovie and as a result for the recent demand in independent slasher films caused by terrifier 2 its a horror retelling of iconic characters, it becomes box office success. but nonetheless with no ones surprise its absolute garbage. in my opinion with that kind of budget its not an easy task to make a film with a decent quality. im impressed by the animated sequence they created for this movie and it was kinda cool. but even the decent production quality, somewhat good cinematography, visual tone, set pieces and locations overshadowed by its very poorly written and atrocious screenplay with a bad ending, slow and tiring pacing, weak performances, lazy direction and an amateur cast with subpar acting abilities.",negative

"i once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on turner classic movies about 6 months back. i thought every minute of what i was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the films middle and i didnt want to spoil the whole thing if i were to watch it from the start, i decided that i would rent it immediately. well, the video store which i frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. i had previous to that experience only seen some chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after i saw the snippet of the great dictator, i checked out three of his other films, city lights, the gold rush, and modern times city lights was great, i found the gold rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and i found modern times to be one of the funniest films ive ever seen second funniest, behind keatons sherlock jr., more exactly. finally, the whole of the great dictator. well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. but these moments dont always mix well. chaplins comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama city lights is the best example of this, but it didnt always work with social commentary. plus, the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of chaplins talent. dont get me wrong, i liked the movie as a whole, but i thought it of little consequence. i would have given it a solid 710 on the ratings scale...if not for the ending. the final speech that the jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. yes, it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. the speech brought me to tears, and i consider it one of the best endings ive ever seen. final score 810.",positive

"as many of my readers have probably noticed, i have a strange affinity for bad films. sure, i also enjoy foreign, independent and classic hollywood filmsbut sometimes i enjoy a film so awesomely bad that it makes me laugh. because of this, i periodically peruse imdbs infamous bottom 100 list to see which films are the lowest rated films of all time. and, aside from a few foreign language pictures which arent available in the us, i have done a pretty good job of finding and watching these turkeys. a few of these incredibly low rated films are actually not that bad, though most are truly terribleand many of also unintentionally funnyand these are my favorites. birdemic, prince of space and eegah are particularly funny examples from the list. imagine my surprise recently when i noticed something very unusual. a new film managed to not only make the list but vault all the way to 1. coming from out of nowhere is the indian film gundaya 2014 offering from directorwriter ali abbas zafar. and, considering my recent articles for influx about my love for indian movies as well as for bad films, i realized that this was a definite mustsee. after all, if i praised bollywood movies for their fun and originality, i have some obligation to mention the bad along with the good. so i wondered, since the movie is ranked as the worst film of all time on imdb, is it really that bad?! is the movie worse than plan 9 from outer space or is it a case where folks are jumping all over a film that really isnt that bad such is the case with glitter or gigli? when gunday began, i could see that it was completely unlike most of the bottom 100. most of these films are ultracheap films with tiny budgets and few were ever considered prestige films. however, gunday clearly is a bigbudget bollywood filmwith all the trappings youd expect from such a film. it has handsome actors, huge song and dance numbers and tons of style. the story is about two orphans who grew up in wartorn bangladesh, bikram and bala. the two are starving and so gravitating towards a life of crime is understandableand this sort of plot is very common in indian films. they are in some ways like robin hoodbigtime mobsters who have a heart for the poor and are their benefactors. because of this and their toughness, no one would ever consider testifying against them and they have become the top crime lords in calcutta. however, a policeman the exceptionally talented irrfan khan has made it his job to take down these criminals. and, in addition, the partners strong bromance is threatened by a pretty young lady who both of them have fallen for big time. the first portion of the film which shows the pair as children is actually very good. it is a compelling story and you feel for them as kids. they face hunger, sexual abuse and many other obstacles and the audience naturally pulls for themeven though they do begin engaging in criminal activities in order to survive. a bit later, however, the film jumps way ahead in time. now the pair played by ranveer singh, arjun kapoor are grown up and are becoming the top criminals in the city. they also have become incredibly sillywith extremely wellcoiffed hair, rakish good looks, shirts always strategically unbuttoned and style, style, style! in fact, they look much more like models in a vidal sassoon advertisement than mobsters! and, to make it worse, they act much like sacha baron cohen in brno or ben stiller in zooolander though these two american films were intended as comedies, not dramatic musicals like gunday! its a strange contrast to see their terrible performances alongside irrfan khanwho, as usual, is terrific. now i am not saying that singh and kapoor will always be bad actorsbut the sorts of performances the director elicited from them are absolutely terrible. does all this bad acting and nonsense rise to the level of awfulness that merits the film being on the bottom 100 list? not really. while the film is pretty dumb at times mostly, i feel due to the direction and performances by singh and kapoor, the film does have a few things going for it. the songs are terrific and catchy. zafar can direct music videosjust not people acting like real people. and, as i mentioned above, irrfan khan is excellent in his role and this indian actor has been getting a lot of well deserved attention in breakout films like slumdog millionaire, the lunchbox and life of pi. plus, parts of the story are interesting though historically inaccurate though i must admit that the film certainly does become tiresome after a while. so why is this poor but not terrible film rated 1 in the badness scale? i can only assume because it was so well publicized, marketed and designed to be a megablockbuster. like the examples i gave above gigli and glitter, this is a case where the public really loves getting on the bandwagon to trash a megafilm. but unlike these two films, gunday actually made a ton of money...yet people hated it! perhaps this makes this movie the one that indians love to hate! all i know is that if zafar can make more failures like this one, hell become an incredibly rich man!! by the way, if youre curious and would like to see the list, its available at httpwww.imdb.comchartbottom?refnvsr1",negative

"this is probably the only time you could fathom comparing a superhero show to another, normal show. i get immediately that seems a bit weird. theres not been many superhero live action projects as of recent or at least not a variety. marvel with their disney money put out a lot of stuff before, but are slowing down when they realise they cant really rival their back catalogue with absolutely dreadful writers. so i havent really watched any superhero projects as of recent that ive liked. i was immediately skeptic of the boys as an uberviolent show and i didnt quite fancy it. i feared it would be, much like the work garth ennis produced in the comics, a good excuse for a lot of bloodbaths and edgy revenge storylines. now im not saying this isnt partially in the show, especially in the immediate, but erik kripke and co. have produced something a lot more with such a simple concept which couldve been wasted on plotless blood spilling. the concept of the boys is simple. supes are real, and theyre everywhere. all superheroes are owned by the private multinational vought industries. as a result, vought are the richest company in the world. products, media coverage, movie franchises, everything is this one capitalist dystopia where a single company is a government sized power with massive influence. vought have an avengers, the seven, headed by homelander, a character not unlike superman. so we have this world which draws parallel with dc and marvel. so what? what good does that do us? well its the gta v to your simcity. the world is messed up, superheroes are all corrupt, and the system is flawed. as a result, next to the massive evil industry tycoon and their superpower cronies, we allow ourselves to make any character who stands against them redeemable enough in the initial, motives and values aside. this is where the show starts in season 1 a group of social outcasts, miscreants and muscle trying to take revenge on the society that left them in awkward positions. hughie campbell, the protagonist is the most redeemable, however we see even he becomes more comfortable with ruthless action to stop the society around him. this is the season 1 and 2 plot to a tee without any major spoilers living in the dark, hiding from supes, blackmail, murder, all paralleled with the thuggish actions of the company who are supposed to be on the side of the good guys. this formula of revenge could start to be repetitive, but every season different core issues are tackled and different new variables come into play. with good writing, some of the best acting performances ive seen in a long time from an original show in its own separate scifi universe. i feel however where the show really takes off is season 3 and 4. now a lot of people say 4 is the worst season of the show. take it from me, who watched the whole show in the last 3 weeks its not. at all. the concept still feels fresh, the ideas are great, there are just notable differences in tone and pace to season 3 which had the most action. season 3 and 4 move on from the revenger ideas and move more to explore the concept of superior life forms and the potential influence they could have on politics, the divisions they could form and the consequences of allowing them too many freedoms. it throws these ideas at all different angles with different powers superheroes in plain sight, superintelligence, you name it theyve done stuff with it. and the show becomes more comfortable in the comedic value of some of its characters. it was great in the first 2 seasons but in the third season the show truly starts to understand what it wants to end on and we see this goal being progressed towards. character growth is nonlinear, with characters seeming to veer in one direction then being set on a completely different path, and i think this is what really makes the show entertaining, in that you physically cannot predict all the ridiculous ideas the superhero concept has never even attempted. the show is a witty mockery of both society and superhero films. the satire is top notch and the enjoyability isnt ruined by concepts. quite the contrary. the concepts define the show and its entertainment. its a show so self aware of what it shouldnt be that it actively inserts what it couldve been into the vought tv channels and movies. overall, a 1010. the only thing which may hold you back is the contents of the show. definitely read the age advisory if youre not a fan of gore, violence or explicit content.",negative

"once again i was deceived by the trailers as they made this movie look absolutely amazing however, the trailers were the only good things that came out of this movie, and that says a lot. first of all, we have the common christian movie stereotype where some of a family is for god, and some of it is against god. than we are provided with the frequent misunderstandings nonchristians face regarding the meaning of scripture due to christians who have almost 0 theological education. so because the christians fail to provide an adequate answer, the nonchristian lashes out. at least provide the audience with some level of complexity if youre going to have some kind of a theological debate. your audience understands more than you think. now if we could simply ignore the horrendous script not to mention the awful acting, we still have a movie full of stereotypes regarding nonchristians, christians, muslisms and even smaller people just trying to be politically correct which got old very fast. but believe it or not, this is not even the worst part of the movie! the worst part is the terrible background music! to put it bluntly, it was garbage!! it was so floaty and totally ruined the atmosphere. now dont get me wrong, some movies require floaty music, but it would have made more sense to have music that was thematically apocalyptic. for example, armageddon, independence day, or world war z each had excellent pieces which blend perfectly into the atmosphere of the movie. the fact is even if the script to a movie is mediocre, having an excellent soundtrack can drastically improve the atmosphere. with a corny 80s saxaphone piece playing in the background, or cheesy orchestral music, which sounded digital, my wife and i walked out of the movie going what did we just see? though i am a pastor, i was hoping to be raptured during the movie. do what i should have done and save your money by not seeing this film.",negative

"jason mamoa was absolutely fantastic in this movie. to me and my wife he was the highlight. he seriously deserves an oscar for bringing a caricature to life and making us care about his character. the cgi was also fantastic vivid, richly imagined, and engrossing. it was remarkable that a majority of the film occurs in the minecraft world and yet it and the real human characters in it felt truly real. truly outstanding work by the whole production team. there was also a lot of laughoutloud moments, and over the top silliness which was a ton of fun. on the way home all of us me, my wife, and our three kids 13,10, 8 were sharing our favorite moments and quips from the film. our kids loved it, and from the engagement i heard of all the kids around us some much younger than ours, everyone was having a good time. id say this is a fun family film anyone from 4 to adult im 47 will enjoy. and thanks again to jason mamoa for committing so hard to his character and jack black for bringing the music and enthusiasm.",positive
"to say this film is writerdirector sean bakers best film ever goes without saying in my opinion. this film is about the tumultuous relationship between a brash 23 year old stripperprostitute from brooklyn by the name on ani mikey madison and the 21 year old son of a russian oligarch named vanya mark eydelshteyn. this relationship leads to quite an emotional and physical roller coaster ride once vanyas parents finds out whats going on. the acting in this film is really well done. but the performance of the lead actor mikey madison was incredible. her joy and pain is felt throughout the entire film. its easy to see why she received a nomination from the golden globes and eventually the academy awards will as well. this film is raw and hard for some audiences to watch i would imagine with the language, nudity, and sex scenes which are necessary for the story and the life ani lives. so you may not want to invite members of your bible study to see it with you. but please dont let you from stopping you from seeing this film due to the acting that is on display.",positive

"young joshua waits michael stephenson and his family head off to the rural town of nilbog to spend their vacation. a dead and creepy grandpa seth appears as a ghost and warns joshua of the danger nilbog is populated by goblins, and its up to joshua to save his family. disclaimer the film is in no way connected to troll and has absolutely no trolls in it. also, the acting with the odd exception of young stephenson is atrocious. the mom is the worst actress ever, but the others are not much better. the daughter, holly, has a really bad dance routine. the director, claudio fragrasso, says the movie is a fairly unpretentious story for children, shot in four weeks and two days in utah. its a pretty amusing film, packed with funny jokes which ridicule horror films in general. i think that he gives himself too much credit, though, as the jokes are not obvious at all. jim harper says that although it is considered one of the worst films ever made, it is reasonably well constructed. however, the script is quite possibly the worst thing fragrasso has ever put his name to, contradicting itself on numerous occasions. quite frankly, the documentary about the film, best worst movie, really sums it up. its bad... but so bad its good. that phrase has never been more true than with this film. i saw this movie sitting on a shelf at walmart on bluray. i do not know why you would want it on bluray, but its available if you do. either way, no matter what format you choose to see it in its also a netflix instant play, its well worth if if you like bad movies.",negative
this show could not have been written by someone associated with big bang theory or two and a half men. i forced myself to watch the first episode until the scene when the train supposedly shook the house. are you kidding me? people think this is funny? that would explain why this country is the way it is. were in big trouble. its like the attempts at humor are from the early nineteen hundreds when film was first invented . i cant believe people are this desperate for a laugh. hollywood hasnt had an original idea in decades. its like theyre writing only for each other. gems like two and a half men and the big bang theory only come along once in a blue moon. shows like george and mandy show that anyone can get hired as a writer. have a blessed day.,negative

"a baby literally bouncing off the walls, a game of super twister, and watching ben steins face separate from his head all mixed into one movie will only bring one thing... the son of the mask. avid cartoonist tim avery jamie kennedy, malibus most wanted, scream trilogy suddenly is burdened to act as a single parent to his newborn son alvey ryan and liam falconer as his wife goes to new york for a week on business. it soon becomes known that alvey has powers of the mask of loki alan cumming, romy and micheles high school reunion, x2. now, loki wants his powers and mask back... based on the fact that littleknown director lawrence guterman cats dogs, headless! had directed this film, i definitely did not expect such work. this film was well put together and could attract many audiences. the acting of this motion picture was fulfilling. kennedy and cumming portrayed their characters well, which was highly expected from the experience they have. appearances from kal penn harold kumar go to white castle and ben stein ferris buellers day off really accentuated the film. transitions throughout the entire hour and 45 minutes were par excellence. noticing this from a genre of the sort is highly unlikely, considering the directors lack of high profile experience, but it did astonish me. as always, with the good comes the bad. the film contained minor hokey elements that i wasnt lured toward. although i felt this way, the preteens of the theatre obtained kicks and giggles from it. ill denounce this upon age difference. son of the mask is rated pg for action, crude and suggestive humor and language. i must admit it was a little harshly rated. this pg kisses the borderline of pg13 at times. the raw and risqu humor and language was periodically unnecessary. a nice additive of the movie was the special effects, which were essential. kennedy spent three and a half hours a day in makeup consisting of foam rubber for the mask. at times, he had to breathe only through a straw. the effects were paid off well as the intrigue struck many viewers. if you are searching for a collective laugh, son of the mask may be a film to invest in seeing. watching the original mask jim carrey would not be a prerequisite to see this movie. however, this movie is aimed towards the younger audiences, so mind that. otherwise, for some good, clean fun, son of the mask may be right up your alley.",positive

"if you havent seen how the grinch stole christmas you cant really fathom what you have been missing. its the perfect message about what christmas is really about, compacted into an efficient 26 minutes, filled with iconic moments and unforgettable songs. its the story of the grinch, a green whoknowswhat that lives north of whoville, and absolutely hates christmas. on one particular christmas eve, he has a wonderful awful idea hes going to steal christmas away from the pesky whos down in whoville! when i say that the songs in this film are unforgettable, i really mean it. this is an instance where the movie if you can call this special a movie is just as good, if not better than the book because of the sounds. not only do we have the awesome narration of mr. boris karloff throughout the story, but the songs in this film are so good they have become permanently ingrained in pop culture. you cant listen to the radio or go to an office party in december without hearing youre a mean one, mr. grinch and id bet you the whos celebration song is a lot of peoples favorites too. theyre are so good that even though they are not found anywhere in any book by theodor seuss geisel a.k.a. dr. seuss, director ron howard felt obligated to include them in his liveaction adaptation of the story. he knew that these tunes are so beloved that people would have vandalized the theater if the iconic melodies had been absent from his film. aside from the music, the film has many other wonderful, sly additions to the original source material. that one image of the grinch coming up with his wonderful awful idea and grinning from eartoear in malice, or the animation of him actually slinking around and grabbing all of the presents, decorations and stockings are truly special. its an added bonus that the film does not run on very long because you will want to include it in your roster of christmas specials every year, if only so you can get a glimpse of that termiteinfested smile. on a more personal note, i find that the ending of the film is particularly heart warming. if you think im giving away the films ending, thats not the case because it ends in a way that you would not expect. it promotes the very best ideals of christmas in a way that does not feel hamfisted or clichd. i only have one criticism. its that you can tell, at several points throughout the film, that the animation budget isnt nearly as high as it should be. i know budgets are really big limitations, but when you see sacks of toys flying in the air two or three times, and the image isnt even mirrored or anything, it feels kind of lazy. this is going to sound like blasphemy, but hear me out. the book this is based on is only about 55 pages long, the illustrations in it are only 2 colors black and red and they have remained the same ever since the story was first published in 1957. this special has been running on television for 48 years. people will buy the dvd, or even the bluray of this film for full price, even though they can catch it for free on cable annually. this property is worth millions. isnt there, or wasnt there maybe some way someone can, or could have gone back to the original director chuck jones and thrown a bunch of money at him to maybe touch up some of the scenes that were missing and had to be filled in with recycled footage? its just a thought, some would even call it a nitpick. i think its a legitimate point to be made, that for the wonderful quality of the narration, the songs and the story, even for the animation overall, there are some sequences where you can tell that some corners were cut. that doesnt really detract from my overall enjoyment of the film, but if you had no idea what this movie was about or you had never seen it before, i feel like i would have to warn you about this portion of the overall package. how the grinch stole christmas is absolutely wonderful. its a true christmas classic, one that everyone can enjoy the tall and the small even if they have seen it time and time again. its part of my annual lineup leading up to christmas and i cant honestly ever see a year where i wont be eagerly anticipating seeing it again. on bluray, december 13, 2014",positive

"the main character nate played by jack quaid is a man with a simple and average life work, playing on the computer and sleeping. what sets him apart from the rest is a rare genetic disease that prevents him from feeling pain. his everyday life changes when he meets a girl with whom he quickly befriends and who also works with him in a bank. everything takes a dramatic turn when she is taken hostage during a robbery of their workplace. the hero forced to act must overcome his weaknesses and use his unusual ailment to find it. although the very concept of a man insensitive to pain who uses it in combat may sound intriguing, unfortunately the film cannot make good use of this potential. the plot is predictable, so almost every scene can be predicted, but maybe except for one and quite a slight twist. despite everything, the whole thing gives the impression of something that we have seen many times, and the script does not even try to add freshness to it. the film is also a dark comedy, but the only moments that made me smile are due to the charisma of jack quaid. his performance is just good, no madness, but throughout the movie i couldnt resist the impression that i was watching hughie from the boys. to sum up an interesting concept was wasted by a boring, predictable plot and not very funny, cheap jokes. its a movie that could rather fit in the background at dinner or cleaning. for me unfortunately a disappointment.",positive
"the reviews are right this time. the cast does its job just fine. the songs and dances are well performed. its a shame, because i feel terrible for the cast. its not their fault. i dont think they knew what visual effects were going to be applied with cgi in post. this film is unintentionally one of the greatest horror movies ever made, worthy of recognition alongside the exorcist. you are that uncomfortable as you sit through it. whoever gave the final goahead to make the cats look the way they look does not know what cats or people look like. the characters do not look quite feline enough and do not look quite human enough. they fall into a gray area somewhere in between and we call this the uncanny valley. this movie is more horrifying than it chapter 1 if you are a coulrophobe. i would rather it were spiders. you would at least know what youre getting into then and i cannot stand spiders. the most nightmarish moments are after certain songs when the cats start meowing or lapping milk and water out of bowls. i felt like the nazis at the end of raiders of the lost ark. i thought my face was going to melt off. my friends and i went to it after laughing at all the bad reviews because we wanted to make fun of it, but its so visually horrid that it held us tight in its uncanny valley grip for the whole of its two hours. who in the production department looked at the finished computer generation of the cats appearances and said, that looks good. lets go with that!? if you go, do not take your children. this movie will horrify them far more than anything pennywise the clown could come up with.",negative

"glen powell, a movie star with charisma, has shown impressive range in top gun maverick and the white lotus. however, will glucks anyone but you fails to generate screen chemistry or laughs, especially with the pedestrian writing. anyone but you is a romcom with banter, hijinks, beaches, and hotties at its center. despite not being the apex of moviemaking, it occupies an interesting inbetween space with breezy watchability and surprising sincerity. the film stars glen powell as ben and sydney sweeney as beatrice, two exexes whose first date ends in disaster. years later, they implausibly pretend to be a couple at the wedding of their respective loved ones, beatrices sister halle hadley robinson and bens childhood friend claudia alexandra shipp. the films breezy watchability and surprising sincerity make it a moviemagical experience that won the reader over. the movie anyone but you is filled with romcom cliches, with some that work and others that dont. the conflict between bea and ben is intense, but their reasoning for pretending to date is halfbaked. the banter is middling, with characters sometimes delivering stilted quips. however, some gags, like ben applying anecdotes from his drugfueled days to presentday situations, play excellently. powell and sweeney compensate for this lack with hilarious physicality, which is the true selling point of the movie. the movie is at its most fun when everyone gets a little ridiculous. for literature nerds, anyone but you is a comedy of errors in true shakespearean fashion, with quotes from the bard himself sprinkled throughout. michelle hurd and bryan brown play opposite each other like titania and oberon, while characters like halle, claudia, and claudias brother pete implement poorly planned schemes to unite ben and bea. there are ample references to much ado about nothing, including character names drawn from that play. anyone but you is a charming film that focuses on familial and romantic love, with a cast including dermot mulroney and charlee fraser. the film intentionally includes side characters, such as the bridestobe, who are played with lively energy, convincingly portraying them as real, loving nearlynewlyweds. the film also features moments of downtime where the characters enjoy time in sydney, australia, enjoying themselves and laughing together. the references and quotes in the film are heavyhanded, but they serve as a harmless shorthand hearkening to the tradition of goofy ensembles and silly misunderstandings that make stories like this enjoyable. anyone but you is a slightly declawed successor to 10 things i hate about you, but one with more gravity than shes the man.",negative

"why would they say to be continued at the end of goal 2 if they werent going to continue it? this movie is absolutely terrible, if they were going to change things so much they should have just made a spinoff movie, which in reality they did. however, this had an introduction of plenty of new characters whose story lines were boring at best. santiago munez is barely even in the movie, and hes the series title character. i absolutely loved the first two and i could not wait for this one. what a a complete and utter disappointment! i wish i had never sought this film out to watch and i just left it at the cliffhanger that was goal iis ending...",negative
"open house started off surprisingly good. i hadnt read any reviews, but i had low expectations because of all the garbage on these streaming platforms these days. the acting was good. characters were interesting. mood was unsettling. camera work, lighting, and sound were all great. i thought i finally stumbled across a real movie. they did a good job introducing the characters and plot. as things started to get creepy, they set up a bunch of red herrings, and kept me guessing. i was actually interested to see how things turned out for the main characters. then, in the last 15 minutes, the movie takes a hard nose dive and resolves the plot in one of the most pointless, unsatisfying ways ive ever seen. turns out, all the character growth, drama, red herrings none of that mattered at all. they gave us a feelbad horror ending that serves no purpose and makes me feel like an idiot for paying attention.",negative

"gigli is a would like to be romantic comedy that stars ben affleck as a lowlevel mobster and jennifer lopez as a toughtalking lesbian hitwoman. the film follows their unlikely and awkward romance as they are assigned to kidnap the mentally challenged brother of a federal prosecutor. the movie suffers from a lack of chemistry between its leads, and the attempts at humor often fall flat due to forced dialogue and awkward delivery. the plots mix of crime, romance, and comedy elements fail to coalesce into a coherent and engaging narrative. the film was also criticized for its tonal inconsistencies and the unrealistic portrayal of characters. its negative reception was largely attributed to its poor script, mismatched casting choices, and overall lack of direction.",negative

"for those of us who have watched kirk cameron pontificate on the wonders of the banana, or read his musings on the legitimacy of the existence of firebreathing dragons, we know that kirk cameron himself is comedy gold. one might expect more hilarity from cameron in saving christmas, but cameron actually intentionally tries to build a comedy here, and the result is an unfunny, unfocused, interminable mess. the film begins with an uncomfortable scene involving kirk cameron sitting in a chair, lecturing at the audience. they dont want us to love christmas, cameron declares authoritatively, never bothering to define exactly who they are. cameron drones on for several more minutes, and at this point in the film, i heard a kid in the back of the theater yawn loudlyperhaps an audible protest that this film would not be the exciting romp promised on the poster. finally, the film cuts away from kirk cameron, and we see several characters enjoying a christmas party. but then we see kirk cameron again, the film freezes, and we hear kirk cameron narrating about himself thats mekirk! more lecturing ensues. eventually, a character by the name of christian almost as clever as josh wheaton, a christian himself, despondently finds his way to a car, apparently disillusioned by the materialism of christmas. enter kirk cameron, who enters the vehicle and does what he does bestmore lecturing. the majority of the film takes place in this car as kirk lectures to christian, with occasional cutaways to biblical imagery. cameron tries to make the case that christmas traditions, such as celebratory trees and gifts, all somehow originated with christianity, not paganism. never mind the fact that ancient paganism predates christianity. last time i checked, god created the winter solstice! is the type of asinine reasoning youll hear from kirk cameron throughout the film. camerons facts are both dubious and sparse, and his connections are spuriousbut christian is nevertheless invariably blown away by kirk camerons apparently amazing insight. perhaps aware that interminable lecturing on its own would be unbearable for an audience, the film provides characters with quirky personalities in an effort to break up the tedium. in particular, we are treated to a scene back in the house of two characters rambling schizophrenically as they drink hot chocolate. it has nothing to do with christians story, it makes the movie feel unfocused, it goes on for far too long, and if my theater is any indication, it is not funny at all. in fact, there was dead silence in my theater throughout the entire run of this comedy film. the film ends with a dance sequence that feels like it lasts ten minutes, as well as multiple, gratuitous blooper scenesi suppose for no reason other than to pad the running time. just when you think its finally over, we see kirk cameron again, and he continues to lecture the audiencethis time about how materialism is just fine, because jesus came to us in a material body, after all. one gets the impression that kirk cameron actually started reading his own bible, was disturbed by what he found such as jesus instruction to go sell your possessions and give to the poor, and produced this film as a desperate justification for his own hypocrisy. at my theater, nobody laughed, and nobody stayed for the end credits. this purported comedy film fails at every level. if youre really looking for a laugh, go back and take a look at what kirk cameron and ray comfort have to say about the glorious design of the banana.",negative

"it isnt jeepers creepers without victor salva at the helm, directing it. jeepers creepers is salvas baby, why someone else is given the directors seat is a mystery. salvas the nature of the beast 1995 remains his best contribution along with rites of passage 1995 and the cult horror film clownhouse starring my favorite actor sam rockwellthe green mile 1999, moon 2009. he is an accomplished director that can weave wonders onto the screen. he is an agrade hollywood director. but a sex scandal and conviction and imprisonment cut short his career for a while. afterwards he was never the same. he fell out of grace when he was at his best. we cannot judge him. we can only appreciate what he gave to the film industry as a whole some terrific movies. back to his film. it is about a creatureor demon or a fallen angel that reappears during a fixed cycle to feed itself from parts chosen from a select and particular group of people it senses fear from. the first two movies reinforce this idea. the third film tried to get into its origins but failed in my belief. nothing was explained into the origins of the creeper. we are still shrouded in mystery. the fourth installment goes nowhere. an interracial couple chaseimran adams and lainesydney craven are heading to the horror hound festival, when laine begins to experience unexplained premonitions and disturbing visions associated with the towns past, and in particular, local legend the creeper. soon they are joined by the creeper himself, hellbent on getting his quota of victims. this then is the premise of jeepers creepers reborn, a feeble attempt at rebooting a franchise that has a cult following. verdict atrocious acting, direction and bad c. g. i. will make you want to leave the theater altogether. if salva saw this mess and i bet he did, hed want to distance himself as far as possible from this. he is too great a director to associate himself with laughable projects like these. you may also like pumpkinhead 1988 and the unnamable 1988 if you havent seen these already.",negative

"this was my first contact with monty python, which i already knew famously, and i loved the movie. it is quite simply one of the high points of british humour. the film is easy enough to understand, parodying the arthurian legends surrounding the quest for the grail, but the story is just a pretext for successive jokes, each one better than the last. i dont know the group of comedians very well, but i do know a number of great british comedy actors here, starting with john clease, terry jones, graham chapman, terry gilliam, michael palin and eric idle. they are very good individually, but priceless together. the film has several moments worth mentioning, starting perhaps with the witch trial, and then moving on to the fight with the black knight or the knights who say ni. its not a very long film, but its really worth seeing every comic situation. the dialogues are full of hilarious moments. the ending, however, is a little less strong than expected, which does not take away from the film any of its merit. technically, its not a remarkable film. there is no concern here with historical accuracy or rigorous recreation of the middle ages, nor does the film ask for it. we have stage costumes and props, obviously fake but functional, and interesting sets, in castles and in some reasonably well chosen places. there are some special effects and visuals, but they arent notable. be that as it may, its a comedy that remains fresh despite the decades that have passed since its debut.",positive
"and left the series where it was. this was made in the eightys a few years after the second one not as good as the first, but pretty good, the first two were made in the seventys and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this. the shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water, they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasnt for a brody descendant and the score this couldve been named something else. it looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film. even dennis quaid did a bad job in this one, if they kept roy schneider it would be worth watching. i only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts. a part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait, but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people. im tired of great movies being ruined by bad sequels. jaws 4 the revenge was worse though, its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the caribbean jaws 4 plot. dont see this or part 4 because they both suck. just watch the first two.",negative
"modern family is primarily a comedy that revolves around three families that are held together more by their virtue of acceptance and love than by the blood ties that connect them. each character has been thoughtfully written out and played to perfection by a slew of actors who take your breath away. a family that is so imperfectly perfect that you draw the expectations for your own family present or future from their actions, morals, decisions and values. its a show where an old rich man marries a young woman of colour where a white patriarchal figure accepts, not without his reservations, his openly gay son and his partner where a gay couple gets its chance at parenting when they adopt an asian girl where we have a teenage pregnancy create the foundations of a loving family where an old couple decides to give parenting a spin in the second innings of their life where each child grows up emboldened with the confidence that his family is there to support himher to become their own person. what the show does impeccably well is throw societal expectations for a toss to underline only one thing who we are and choose to be does not dictate the rightness or the wrongness of our being. the only this that does is the purity of our hearts. that is it. one episode after the other, we have the writers create interwoven and hilarious narratives into episodes that break stereotypes and societal conventions to showcase the meaningless of their existence. despite the seriousness of the central theme, the show is outright hilarious. it is witty much too witty to understand every joke, every emotion, every retort in just one watch. the writing is spot on. it makes you live the characters and fall in love with each one of them one episode at a time. its made me pause the show because i had to laugh so bad. it has also made me pause to make way for a few tears which flowed without announcement, without purpose. the families, despite their eccentricities and unconventional way of being, are ever so relatable in how they love one another. the only way to truly love someone is to let them thrive in their own choices thats what i learn from this show every day. its unparalleled what this show has done for the people who were too scared to come out of their closets and the parents who were too scared to have a kid who did. i cannot recommend this show enough. you will feel a myriad of emotions when you truly embrace the depth of the stories and therein lies its beauty.",positive

"alone in the dark reviewed by the correct critic alone in the dark is an appropriate title for the first film i ever saw alone in a dark theatre. its a good thing i saw this disaster alone, because if i had asked a friend along, i would have been dreadfully embarrassed. most of the januaryfebruary movie fare is as tempting as my mothers cream cheese and jelly sandwiches. with the oscar buzz high, studios feel the hype over the best picture nominations will drown out any talk of these duds. hollywood may even make a few million dollars off these disgraces without drawing criticism that 90 of movies released in january or february are not worth two dollars, let alone nine or ten. that said, alone in the dark barely qualifies as one of these duds, because it is hardly a movie. the plot, if you insist. well, there is no plot, but rather an incomprehensible premise based on an atari video game. christian slater plays edward carnby, a paranormal investigator. an insult to the warrens, carnby is trying to solve a mystery. during carnbys youth, he and eighteen other orphans were abducted from a home for a brief time. carnby possesses little recollection of that fateful night. tara reid plays carnbys girlfriendexgirlfriend, a museum archaeologist specializing in abskani artifacts. tara reid as a scientists yeah, thats believable. attempting to show she is no longer the allamerican pie girl, reid adds a rough edge to her voice, only to sound like she suffers from emphysema. her acting suggests she is smoking something, and i am not talking about nicotine addiction. thrown into the mix is a mad scientist, a team of paranormal investigators under the title 713, zombies, and halfinvisible creatures. the filmmakers feel these elements tie together the audience may not share their perspective. the director, uwe boll, is on the same level as ed wood, a man voted worst director of alltime by a critical survey. but while ed wood and his monster movies were laughable come on, the man was a transvestite, there is nothing funny about uwe boll. i was astounded to discover that this man, who has his characters spout the clich lines its happening again and some door were never meant to be opened, actually has a ph.d. in literature. alone in the dark is one of the two worst movies i have seen in my life. the other is a film adaptation of antigone our english class viewed last year. that horror consisted of five spoken words, a nailsonthechalkboard score, and a bunch of females licking each other. you can always identify the worst movies, because they are literally painful to sit through. the obnoxious, earsplitting noises meant to scare and the flashing of machine gun fire in alone in the dark gave me a headache. they should have cut the movie down to 30 seconds, and aired it during the super bowl as a live action halo 2 commercial. does alone in the dark have any redeeming qualities? aside from instilling aspiring filmmakers with hope and confidence, no. if i had the time, i would definitely stand outside my local cinema and picket this garbage. this is the movies at their absolute worst the citizen kane of poor filmmaking folks. a sin against the art, alone in the dark will be damned to the ninth circle of dantes inferno, where it will spend eternity frozen in black solitude.",negative

"there are many films about con artists and confidence games oceans eleven and its two or three sequels, for example, but i had never seen one that was so goodnatured and in which the main characters were so likable. its a light, family comedy from the 70s, in which a group of tricksters decides to risk their lives to deceive a powerful and rich mobster in order to avenge a friend, killed by his hitmen. this film was, at the time, a huge financial success in the usa and won notable awards, especially seven academy awards best film, best director, best original soundtrack, best original screenplay, best costume design, best editing and best art direction! therefore, it is difficult to believe that a film with such qualities has been forgotten, but it is true. i never saw it on television, i never heard much about it, i dont think it even had much visibility outside his country of origin. in portugal there wasnt, but i understand why the film premiered the day before the country experienced a military coup against the government, and the rest of that year was very complicated here, so no one was very willing to go to the movies. therefore, i think that recapping this film and bringing it back to theater, in a possibly restored version, would be a gesture of complete justice to its quality. the film has three enormous actors who deserve praise for the work done here robert redford shows value and talent in a film that will open many doors for him, robert shaw offers us one of the best dramatic exercises of his artistic maturity and paul newman shines and enchants us in the role of an elegant and friendly swindler full of tricks. seeing these three great actors together on stage is simply delightful. the film also has a good secondary cast, with robert earl jones, charles durning, eileen brennan, ray walston and other good artists. on a technical level, we have to surrender to the impeccable cinematography achieved by the meticulous eye of director george roy hill, in cooperation with a team of good professionals, and which perfectly emulates old films from the 30s with the advantage of color, in tones deliberately brownish, golden and yellowish. the sets, props and costumes are simply incredible the cars can make classic admirers salivate and the costumes deserve a place in the closet of any gentleman with a taste for the oldstyle elegance they exude. the period is well recreated and the situations balance dramatic tension and humor well. the soundtrack is solidly based on scott joplins piano melodies and is wonderful to listen to, and the titles are magnificently welldesigned and have art in themselves. its a long film, two hours long, but its so delightful to watch and so well edited that time flies by.",positive

"this nonmasterpiece follows in the footsteps of several other pathetic attempts at turning a successful videogame franchise into a successful movie franchise. this one pales in comparison to the original mortal kombatwhich was actually pretty good....surprisingly enough. it seems as though the filmmakers were too busy adding as many special effects shot and characters as possible from the videogame, rather than worrying about any type of story or character development. the characters came off as overly stereotypical and twodimensional. this movie might have been more enjoyable sans dialogue, as at least the action sequences were intense and well choreographed. i really wish that the producers of this stinker would have put a little bit more thought into the actual plot rather than just money into the special effects budget. i guess what im trying to say is that if you liked the first movie....... then steer clear of this one..... i mean.... why bother?",negative

"this movie is a fun summer musical for the family, with lively music and dancing, and of course, a typical romantic story, all set on the beach. it showcases the voices of justin guarini and kelly clarkson, as well as a few others. justin lights up the screen whenever he is on it, which is not enough. he has such presence, i found myself wishing him to be in every scene. i look forward to the dvd where they will hopefully put in deleted scenes. it was truly enjoyable, light, entertaining, and quite simply fun. go with the right attitude, do not expect it to be anything but what it is, and you will have a blast!",negative

"i really dont get this constant critical bashing of the type of silly comedies like adam sandler makes. critics and moviegoers alike know what kind of comedy he produces, and know this going into each and every single new film that comes out, yet they feign surprise and disappointment at each new turn, acting as if they thought it was going to be some oscar worthy performance. apparently, youre not allowed to make lowbrow, silly comedies for the simple purpose of being silly and just a simple laugh, and apparently its even worse if you make such movies and they are financial successes as sandlers tend to be. granted, i myself have felt that in the last few years, sandlers films havent been as funny. you dont mess with the zohan was just weird, and while just go with it was alright, it wasnt hilarious either. grown ups, which with its snl reunion cast, should have been hilarious, but it only provided a few chuckles, because in this mans opinion they played it too safe. they tried to go for a family comedy, when it should have been classic snl type material. click, in my estimation, was his last really strong comedy, and it worked successfully in the silliness and drama departments. having said that though, i just went to see jack and jill last night, and you know what? it was pretty damn funny. im not afraid to say i liked it, nor to admit that i laughed quite a bit at this lowbrow, juvenile humored film. i have been a fan of sandlers work since his snl days, and with very few exceptions, ive liked the majority of his output. but this film reminded me much more of the purely rampant silliness that his best movies are known for. it doesnt try to be anything more than what it is, unlike something like, say, funny people, which quite frankly, wasnt. jack and jill is what it is a silly and ridiculous comedy, with that patented sandler spin on it. adam sandler is one of those figures that you either like or you dont. thats fine. so is al pachino, who quite frankly turned in a surprising and heartfelt performance. he wasnt afraid to act silly, and he honestly looked like he was enjoying himself making this, not just that he needed the money. perhaps if more people untightened their sphincters just a bit, and quit trying so hard to be overlypretentious, overly cynical wannabe movie critics, theyd grow up a bit and realize that you can, in fact, just go to a movie to relax and enjoy yourself, and not have to be viewing everything with a critical eye 247. if you go to a comedy like this expecting some life changing, coenbrothers level of acting or cinematography, youre a moron. just the same as if you have ever gone into a jet li or jackie chan film expecting anything more than some awesome martial arts moves. judd apatowseth rogan style comedies are honestly no less silly, outlandish, or straight up stupid than sandler films, yet because theyre rated r and feature copious amounts of party humor, as opposed to potty humor, they get more critical acclaim. fact is for the most part, theyre both funny. you just have to be mature enough to drop your facade, lighten up a little, and laugh along with the stupidity. thats what comedies are for. period.",negative
"i saw this beautiful film after a high expectation. and it deserves this expectation. for acting and for the impeccable story, for the clash between two different lives and visions but having the same heart, for the delicate precise definition of the challenges for catholic church in xxi century , for the status of parable and for the splendid end. i admire joseph ratzinger and this film is new proof than i am not wrong . because anthony hopkins gives the fundamental traits of a scholar becoming pope . because jonathan pryce has the subtle force to propose not a hero but a vulnerable man looking for the fair answer to the life of church in the city circle, responding to the spiritual sons in the most honest manner. a beautiful film in each scene and detail.",positive
"laapataa ladies is a beautiful movie tugging at your heart gently. there is comedy, there is emotion, there is a bit of mystery...and a lot of subtle entertainment. the movie is set in remotest of village still even a metropolitan woman can relate to it. the story is about two brides who get exchanged in train journey because of their long veils. and how they find themselves in the process of finding their real homes. kiran rao has done a tremendous job. characters are so well written, performances are so natural, makeup, dress so real...nothing overboard...just perfect. showing us the reality of society without being preachy, hailing feminism still nothing against men but definitely taking a dig at patriarchy. when the lady of the house says i dont even remember what my choices are anymore....i think every women married for more than 10 years will relate to it. casting is impeccable i think casting directors are really helping, all actors are flawless specially nitanshi goel, she is as innocent and beautiful as phool and so convincing that whole film is based on her innocence. ravi kishan just steals your heart at the end. you will enjoy the movie thoroughly, such basic story line but still kept it interesting through out. such nuanced writing, excellent job done kudos to new age film makers, no dearth of talent in our country, nepotism or not. good work will always shine. sajni song and dheeme dheeme could have been promoted more , it would have really helped the movie.",positive

"i love back to the future. while having a typical 80s feel to it, which i like, i love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. the special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. the score by alan silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so i think anyway. robert zemekiss direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. and i have to mention the acting, michael j fox is really appealing in the role of marty mcfly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and christopher lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable rolesand yes this includes judge doom from who framed roger rabbit? and professor plum from clue. lea thompson and crispin glover are also great. overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 1010 bethany cox.",negative

"cowboy bebop will break any prejudgement youve ever had on anime. simply put, the show is amazing. from the art, to the music, and most importantly, the story line cowboy bebop delivers. although most reviewers have summed up the storyline fairly well, ill give a brief overview. in the not so distant future, many planets have been colonized and huge technological advancements have been made, but enough with the obvious. two men, spike and jet meet up with future comrades faye and ed and team up or fly it solo to form the most effective bounty hunting team in the universe. technology benefits both bounty hunter known as cowboys and criminal as the crew of the bebop ship try to make an honest wulong the futuristic form of currency while each member encounters shades of their illuminous past. a huge bondship amongst the characters is felt almost from the start, despite ongoing tensions on the bebop. furthermore, each character is given at least two whole episodes, which elaborate on their past, which intertwines oddly with the present an ongoing theme in cowboy bebop. their pasts are as diverse as their personalities and at some points youll have a hard time even figuring out who the main character is. one is a former worker of a crime syndicate, one a former police officer, one a thief, and the last a computer hacker. some similarities do exist though, namely stylish outfits and attitudes, but even then, these similarities are very few. the coolest thing about cowboy bebop is its ability to give you something drastically different each session dont call it an episode, its a session. some sessions wrap you up in action, some make you cry, still some sessions will make you roll on the ground in laughter. one thing for sure is you will get a very satisfying feeling once the credits hit. the soundtrack for the entire series is another high point. virtually each session is entangled in some form of sophisticated music, usually jazz, which is a welcome breeze from the stagnation of todays modern music. compared to other anime, bebop reigns supreme along with a couple of others, and puts kids shows like dragon ball z which are virtually plotless in the light of cowboy bebop to shame. this is definitely worth viewing if youre looking for something new to watch, but worried you might just fall victim to another piece of trash reality show or sitcom. your previous conceptions of anime are about to be shattered.",positive

anyone but you is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genres strengths. all its beats are predictable in the best way. sydney sweeney and glen powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. the constant barbs they send each others way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry theyre constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it. this isnt will glucks first rom com and thats apparent in the good ways. the broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and its surprisingly epic a lot more helicopter stuff than expected. a good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it.,positive

"needing help to deal with a powerful member of the russian mafia, commandant rakov christopher lee of the city of moscow requests the assistance of commandant lassard george gaynes along with some of his best police officers to advise and assist them. however, when his team gets there they discover that there are those within the moscow police department who arent so keen on obtaining their help. likewise, captain harris g. w. bailey has his own agenda which isnt necessarily the same as everyone else as well. at any rate, although the movie started off well enough it soon reverted to the same old gags featured in all of the other films in this series and everythingand everyoneseemed to be simply going through the motions. additionally, nobody really stood out one way or the other either. in short, although there were a couple of fairly entertaining films in this series, the sad fact is that everything has pretty much run its course and the thrill is clearly gone. i have rated this movie accordingly. below average.",negative
"i have seen many films but none compare to the sheer horror i encountered upon watching this horrendous ego project gone awry. the director tried to get artsy, setting the camera at a 45 degree angle, and using the star wars scene change wipes, neither of which worked for this film. apparently the psychlon aliens are 8 feet tall because of the 6 feet tall boots they wear. dialogue that was just so bad its funny.",negative
"director bill melendez, script charles m. schultz this is my second favorite of all the classic christmas specials. the first being rudolph the rednosed raindeer. according to imdb, this is the first televised adaption of the peanuts comics. all of the principal voices were recited by children. one thing about this special that i have always liked is the fact that it is one of the few christmas specials that tells the real meaning of christmas. it has many funny moments but it addresses some serious issues such as the over commercialization of christmas and what christmas is all about as explained by linus in the school auditorium. remember, this was made in 1965. when it comes to the commercialization of christmas, i wonder what old charley brown would feel today! this cartoon special is remembered and well loved by us old peoplein our 30s and 40s and it is enjoyed by our children today as well. this special also features one of my favourite christmas songs.",positive
"although id still say that this season is worth watching, i have to also say that it is most definitely nowhere near as good as season 1. first of all, stories of s2 are best described as meah. aside from the e3 and e4 that were somewhat interesting andor thoughtprovoking and e6 that made me chuckle a bit, the rest are completely forgettable. second, this season seams to be positively muted in terms of sheer madness and creative scope of the first one. why this is would be anybodys guess, but my sense is that the network decided to play it safe instead of embracing the sometimesprovocative insanity of the first season. finally, this season contains less than half the number of episodes of the first one, why??? i get not being able to film real actors during the time of the pandemic, but what was stopping a bunch of it and cgi pros from creating a bunch of episodes while sitting comfortably in front of their computer screens at home...truly beyond me. so here we are, still enjoyable to watch, but doesnt even begin to hold a candle to the first season. what a shame, such a missed opportunity.",positive
"this sequel to the first mortal kombat is pretty good, but i did not like it that johnny cage had to die at the beginning. hes one of the very important characters in the mortal kombat franchise. now this sequel includes more characters from the franchise and it also includes the return of subzero and scorpion. of course they did appear only for a couple of minutes but still it was worth seeing them in this. in this movie liu kang has to fight shao khan raidens brother in order to save the world and all other realms. with the help of sonya, jax, katana and raiden they defeat shao khan and the world is saved. as for raiden he becomes one of the elder gods. now there are people on here who dont like this as much as the first one but i say its a pretty fair sequel and still worth watching.",negative
"at one time or another, a movie is made about every generation. dazed and confused is for the survivors of the 1970s that group of americans who came of age when bellbottoms, love beads, mantras, and marijuana were the fashion, drinking and driving hadnt become taboo, and safe sex was used only to avoid pregnancy or vd. as the united states reached her bicentennial, vietnam was over if the memories still lingered and the shortlived disco craze was building to a frenzy that saturday night fever would both exploit and exacerbate. this movie begins on the last day of the 197576 school year, and finishes less than twentyfour hours later. for randy pink floyd jason london and his friends, its the end of their tenure as high school juniors, and with the final bell of the last period, they have reached the ultimate goal for teenagers they are seniors. at the local junior high school, mitch kramer wiley wiggins and his cohorts have a serious problem to consider. they are members of the incoming freshman class and, as part of a timehonored tradition, they are about to be totally and painfully humiliated by the new seniors. dazed and confused explores the beginning of the 1976 summer from the varying perspectives of an unusual group of characters. just about every type is represented the timid nerd looking for a way to break out of his shell, the mindless jock, the overaged twentysomething guy who likes hanging out with teenagers, the blond bombshell, the stonedoutofhis mind pot addict, and the timid newcomer. writerdirector richard linklater slackers is only partially successful in his attempts to avoid making his characters into caricatures. most of what works with the youthful population of dazed and confused is due more to the performances of a fine cast than the writing. there isnt much to this picture. the storyline is minimal and the characters personalities are as hazy as the marijuanadrenched atmosphere. what linklater does exceptionally well is open the door on an era seventeen years in the past. this is 1976, from the music and cars which combined cost a huge chunk of the 6 million budget, to the people and their attitudes. youd have to climb into a time machine to get a better view. comparisons with american graffiti are warranted, remembering, of course, that this is the next generation. both have similar aims, but while graffitis plot may have been no less insignificant than that of dazed and confused, its characters are better defined. at times, linklater seems too wrapped up in getting everything right about the time period. while the directors of both films care about their protagonists, george lucas does a better job of transferring that feeling to the audience. the cast is one of new or barelyrecognizable names and face michelle burke, who went on to do coneheads, is among the few who might tweak the memory. none of the principals can have a clear memory of 1976 unless theyre a lot older than they look, yet they play their roles like they lived through it. most memorable of all is wiley wiggins mitch, who performs almost every scene including one where he buys his first sixpack with an affecting blend of charm and realism. dazed and confused is irresponsible and politically incorrect, and almost worth applauding on those grounds alone. overall, however, this is light entertainment nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy. this film was made to celebrate a dead culture, and those who were part of it, or are merely curious, will find a path into the past through it. unfortunately, due to the weakness of the script, they wont find anything substantial there.",positive

"looking at the imdb reviews it seemed rather strange to me that most of them the top ones at least were quite outdated, written in 20052006 actually or the reviewers had not seen more than 50 or 100 episodes. having said that please note that i have seen 610 episodes and 2 moviesstrong world, film z as of the day im writing this review. i hope my review will provide you with valuable insight to the series or even convince you to watch it. i will try to be as spoiler free as possible. its been about a year since i started watching anime regularly and that is something i have yet to regret. i mostly enjoy short anime with less than 50 episodes that have good plot and well made characters, anime like cowboy bebopmy favorite, mushishi, ergo proxy, code geass etc. i knew about anime like op, naruto, bleach even before i started watching anime but kept avoiding them even when i had seen about 50 i must have seen over 100 now xd other anime mainly because i thought to myself how can they be any good when they have that many episodes? arent they out of ideas yet?. well i might be right about naruto and bleach but when it comes to one piece i couldnt be more wrong. one piece is so good, so enjoyable and it never ends which is something everyone who is watching it wants. talk about long introduction huh? anyways onto the actual review now. it will be divided into 4 sectors story, characters, art and sound, enjoyment. story now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward, a young boy monkey d. luffy 17 years oldsetting out on sea on a great journey to become the pirate king and find one piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the op world that was left in that place by the former pirate king, gol d. roger. before roger was executed publicly by the marinesworld government he told everyone that if they wanted op they had to look for it and that it was all left in that place and that ignited the great age of pirates. the series is divided into arcs, each featuring its very own story and setting, each island, each place the straw hat pirates luffy and his crew visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances. and thats one of the best things of op, you never get bored. you are fascinated by the huge and diverse op world and you just cant let go of it. everything is interesting and everything is fun, luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers. thats something very rare especially in anime and op handles that expertly. once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series, especially luffy, dont really care about their destination, hell most of the times they dont even know where they are going at all. all that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things, get stronger, meet new people and face powerful foes. another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers episodes that did not exist in the original storysource materialmanga unlike some other mainstream anime seriesnaruto, bleach anyone?. also the fillers are actually not that bad, sure they are not good but many of them are ok. and thats a huge plus for an anime series. characters this is where op really shines. each character is presented with great detail, they are all quite unique. everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are, why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams. due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other. we see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other, they become something very close to a family. thats the kind of bonds they make. furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines. we see why they make the kind of choices they make. nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good. everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause, in their own justice and in their own dreams. art and sound one piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation. the sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics. the characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other thats a huge plus in anime. the sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors, im always talking about the original japanese dont you dare see the english dub,who fit really well into their respective characters. the music, for me at least, is very catchy and actually really well made. however that depends on personal taste, if you are not really into this kind of karaokejapanese style of music you might not like it. nevertheless op really has some of the greatest music themes i have heard in an anime. overall enjoyment one piece is one of the most, if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find. it really excels in pretty much every field there is. it is the only anime series, or any series, i have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that goodand believe me, have i seen a lot. i recommend op to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure. if you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not oh you will want to continue. trust me and you wont regret it, just like i did. and yep thats the end of it fellas. if you enjoyed my review and found it useful please upvote so others can see it. 2021 update ive been on the fence about deleting this since its so poorly written, i was 17 at the time of writing and not a native speaker, and my opinion on one piece and anime in general has changed dramatically for the worse. but i figured i might as well leave it be since people seem to like it and it serves as a kind of snapshot of my 17 year old self whose input other hopeful 16 and 17 year adventurers out there might find helpful.",positive

"we were all pleasantly surprised by the fresh take on the columbo 1971 reverse mystery formula with poker face 2023, and here we have cbss attempt at that subgenre with mixed feelings. for those unaware, the reverse mystery is not a whodunnit but a howcatchem. in this format, the crime is depicted first in full view of the audience. there is no doubt who did it. the fun them comes when the detective comes in and finds all the little things the killer gets wrong, and we get to watch as the perfect crime slowly unravels. peter falk as columbo did this to great affect with his little questions, constant one more thing jibes, and the reveal that point where the killer knows the game is up is more often than not very satisfying. not so much here. now introduce elsbeth tascioni who is wellknown to those who follow the franchise. shes a quirky somewhat neruodiverse lawyer who has a special point of view of the world, and has a talent for seeing the little things. now elsbeth is on loan to monitor the nypd, and manages to ease her way into leading an investigation into a murdered actress. i have no love of new york or the nypd, but i do take exception with law enforcement being depicted as outright incompetent. theres a perfect crime scene, where the killer has covered all the bases to make the murder appear a suicide. open and shut wheres the donuts. only elsbeth comes in and finds three or four completely obvious clues that suggest that the suicide might be murder. of course, the cops are all bothered and unimpressed by her insights. wait in the hall, shes repeatedly told. but shes having none of it, and continues to pokeandprod and even does a one more thing bit. while im overall happy with this show shot beautifully to make you believe that every day is sunny in new york its not the writing is extremely weak and it shows. no spoilers here, but come on the mystery is so shallow that it almost seems the killer didnt have to work so hard. the little things that elsbeth notices are so obvious and in plain sight, a trained police detective would have to be completely incompetent not to notice them. this show is almostbutnotquite family friendly. the violence is subdued, and the killer goes in classic columbo fashion with calm and grace, even asking where did i slip up? so, no fist fights, no car chases, no shouting matches. only disdain for elsbeth to go wait in the hall. i have overall hopes for this show that it will improve. this installment was weaker than the weakest of columbo episodes. heres hoping the mysteries can get deeper and the howcatchem can be satisfying again.",positive

"i have a weird obsession....to see every film on imdbs infamous bottom 100 list. barb wire is currently 44....and my 94th film on this list! however, after seeing it, i am not sure that it really deserves to be on the list. sure, pamela anderson got the razzie award for her performance and it is a dopey film...but unlike most of the films on the list it was never intended to be a good movie. it simply was made as an excuse to dress and undress anderson in very revealing clothes! its not what anyone would consider a masterpiece, not was it ever intended as one....just a film to show as much of the lady as she was willing to show. and, in places such as the opening credits you see a lot. barb wire is based on a comic book by dark horse, a company known for characters such as the mask, hellboy and comics like sin city. again....none of these characters or films were ever intended to be carried by the criterion collection nor to be up for academy awards! in this story, anderson plays the title character, a combination stripper, hooker and assassin. and its all set in a dystopian and dark world...of the usa in 2017! she strips, turns tricks and leaves bodies where ever she goes! she also, interestingly, sounds like shes doing a steven segal impersonation in the film...softly mumbling most of her lines. bad enough for a razzie? i wouldnt say so...but its not like im in charge of giving out these infamous awards! you can probably assume that i thought the film was pretty dumb....and youd be right. but its exactly what many folks wanted in 1996...a chance to see anderson at least seminaked. it delivers this....along with a dark, silly and not especially enjoyable story. if you actually just want to see ms. andersons body, skip to the special features on the disc and select sexy outtakes....then you can skip the silly movie entirely and just see what most folks who watch the dvd really want anyway. by the way, the opening song was word up....an extremely catchy rbhiphop song by cameo. but, oddly, some other folks perform it...and its not nearly as good as the original. i wonder why they didnt just pay for the rights to the original....i cant imagine it would have been that expensive.",negative
"one piece, what can i say? it has become a part of my life, wait no, one piece is my life. it is the most beautiful thing mankind has ever created. all thanks to mastermind oda. starting off with facts of it being the highest selling manga and being in the guinness book of world records, also having an extremely dedicated fan base which no community can ever have. its simply the greatest story ever conveyed and portrayed in a comical form. as ive seen many movies and tv showswhich includes american tv shows, indian cinema. read thousands of books, no story has ever enlightened and amazed me as one piece did, i personally feel it to be on par with mahabharata, ramayana shakespeares works. 732 episodes, 819 chapters still looks fresher than ever, without being monotonous, not only it entertains you, it scars you for life. a show so strong, that it changes your life. a show so good you can never stop watching. its more addictive than any drug in this world. coming to the characters, monkey d luffy, even people say he is typical shonen material, he is the greatest protagonist a story can possibly have. he goes from dumb funny to badass idealistic. hes like a brother i never had. roronoa zoro, a lad so influential with his quotations, you start following his mannerisms in real life. with many characters and their unique personalities. i dont want to spoil anything for you, get amazed by the characters by yourself, im sure oda will never disappoint you. coming to the story, as ive already mentioned, it is the 8th wonder of world. what amazes me the most is, oda is so legendary that he depicts real life events from this world through his manga. hes also a conspiracy theorist. with psychologists and business strategists watching one piece, to learn more about leadership, makes it far superior than any anime or tv show or novel or anything. there a lots of things i wanted to say, im bipolar, i dont remember anything ive watched, im very lazy since ive always been under heavy medication. watching one piece makes me happy. its the best thing that ever happened to me. just imagine what it takes for a lazy person like me to write a 300 word review. that is how much one piece moved me. for me the animation of the anime was always consistent and i personally recommend you subbed version, dont even consider the opinions of people whove just watched 30 or 40 episodes or so, or people who are extremely ignorant. one piece will change your life and im pretty sure it will be the best thing that will ever happen to you. thank you.",positive

"i dont really have anything more to say about bucky lawson born to be a star, but in all fairness, i should mention two stuff that made me slightly amused, although they have nothing to do with the movie itself. the first is don johnsons concept of playing miles deep as a porn industry vet.this is not particularly funny, but i kept thinking it might have been more funny if his character had also been named don johnson, as well as a completely acceptable porn name de plume.look, i didnt say it was that funny, just funnier than anything in the movie. the other thing is that edward herrmann, in the same week this movie is published, will also see the launch of a project more adapted to his talents, the voice of roger eberts autobiographys audio version, life itself.in other words, roger ebert is only one degree of separation from the people responsible for bucky larson. as he is currently at the toronto international film festival, i couldnt ask what he thought about this connection, but i think that if i had, his response would have been a mildly abashed nod and a request for a purell bottle of contagion size.believe me, the feeling i understand.",positive

"well folks, you guessed right. just got back from seeing a screening, and i truly dont think ive seen a movie any less memorable since...well, a long time. now of course, my only reason for seeing the movie was that alyson hannigan was in it. i wont lie. but talk about wanting 1 12 hours of your life back. the movie barely had a plot, so it was just a bunch of unrelated, unfunny parodies, if you can call them that. i can take some crude humor, but this movie was just unnecessary. they really missed the mark in some scenes...someone should explain to them that a parody doesnt mean filming the same scene with different actors. there were a few snide remarks that made me chuckle, but everything about this movie made me remember why i dont like seeing the socalled mainstream movies. and the lead guy...not good looking. at all. if im going to be staring at some guy for 90 minutes, at least make it worth my while. so all in all, the jokes fall flat, and the movie really missed a chance to create something quite funny, since a parody of date movies, had it been done well, could have been hilarious. but this movie is far from that. you let me down, alyson hannigan. sigh and another thing, it shouldnt be called date movie if it mocks every genre. random star wars references and jokes about how advanced technology is stopped being funny...what, 5 years ago? i was hoping for something as onthemark as not another teen movie, but all i got was a big waste of time. thank god it was free.",positive
"love, death robots is a visually stunning anthology series created by netflix to showcase different types of animation and the different stories that can be told through them. the first 3 seasons are ambitious in a way that pushes the technology the animators are suing to the absolute limit. all the episodes approx. 20 minutes long are very different in animation style, but a very unique in how they use the animation to tell a story that can only be told using animation. some of the episodes are very bloody and gory, creating a very cerebral experience for the audience. i would recommend this show to someone who appreciates the hard work behind animation, or a brave soul who is looking for something to expand their mind of film.",positive

"okay, the best way to enjoy hotd is to get in touch with your inner ten year old child. if you cant enjoy cheesy b flicks like that, then dont go. if youre the kind who quotes the romero bible, dont go. zombies arent limited by rules, only the limits of your imagination. as corny as you might find that, it may be the best way to enjoy this very flawed movie. hotd is, at best, a roger cormanscifi channel type of film. bad cheese, but ive seen worse. best reason to watch jurgen prochnow and ellie cornell. they have the most dignified characters, the most common sense, and the best lines. they also have the best death scenes if youre into that kind of critiquing kira, will and ona really try, but the script fails them and the other cast members the music wasnt so bad, and the action scenes kicked butt. i can tolerate the arcade stuff added in. its not that annoying if you simply accept this as an arcade action flick and not a horror film. i wanted to see the gang kick zombie butt, and i got my moneys worth. worst elements the script dialogue. ellie and jurgen get the best lines. otherwise, there is not an ounce of wit or clever banter. rudy is the worst hero since stephen dorffs cop from fear dot com and jared letos paul from urban legends. casper and kirk should have been the main characters since they at least tried to save everybody, while rudy just stares at his current girlfriend getting ripped to shreds. sloppy editing. stupid teen antics. biggest mistake in the whole film is to have rudy open the movie with the lines if they hadnt come, theyd still be alive. this has killed any suspense of seeing who survives in the end! i dont think its a terrible film, despite my comments. its a cheesy b flick, nothing more. but i do hope that uwe boll and mark altman learn from these flaws. a sequal is in the planning stages, which may be better than the first if they write and shoot a more clever script",negative

i was forced to go see this with a friend for her birthday. i knew it would be dumb but thought that it would at least be something to laugh at. it was one of those rare movies that is too bad even for perverse entertainment. as it began i thought well the story will be stupid but maybe it will have good songs. the songs were the worst part! the transitions into these musical numbers were so awkward. and the songs themselves were not remotely entertaining. kelly comes off as likable in the movie but i grew to despise every other character in the space of 15 minutes. i dont see this becoming a cult classic. it also made me feel relieved that i never went to florida for spring break. kelly clarkson is a sweet girl but she should stick to singing and get a new agent.,negative
"okay, this movie was just terrible. uwe boll is the worst director to ever exist. bad acting, bad story, bad makeup, bad cinematography, etc. lets just say there was not one single thing about this movie that was good. first of all, what the hell was the deal with the zombies? they were gargoyles with glowinthedark red eyes.. zombies dont look like that. those things were the least scary things ive ever seen in my entire life. id be more afraid of a dandelion stem than i would the zombies in this movie. the acting was so bad, even worse than the worst youve seen in any other b movie. it was so bad, that it wasnt even funny. sometimes, in b movies, the acting is really cheesy which makes it funny. the acting in this movie was far beyond that. it was just bad. and, thats whats just sad. the incredibly cheesy video games are better in every way than the terrible movie. the acting, story, etc. are all lame and cheesy, but far better than the schlock in this waste of film. even the pixelated, cartoonish zombies look so much more realistic than the black, redeyed swamp thing zombies in this movie. how the hell does uwe boll keep getting work? he continues his streak of destroying video game franchises, most recently with bloodrayne, and now i hear hes doing hitman, and more. hey, hollywood.. why do you keep hiring this guy to direct?! his movies are the worst ever made in history, and they make no money. seriously, somebody needs to kick this jackass out of the film industry.",negative

"i had almost given up on american productions of the romantic comedy genre, especially the ones that seen boxed in by the hallmark frame. i had turned to other nationalities for this genre who seemed able to think outside the hallmark box. im not sure why this one works, because it does operate within the box but in a quirky way. the vehicle of the mother is well used in this film, the writing is such that the obvious turns are not so obvious, and thus fulfill their destiny a little better than most hallmark fare. the film got under my skin. the casting was well done. the music was really well done. the movie opens into a song by the new pornographers, which is so well used and close with the wonderful. my house is a very very fine house and by the time the movie gets to that i that song seems so relevant and rich.",positive

"my thoughts on sonic 3 honestly, sonic 3 really surprised me. this time, the focus was on sonic, shadow, and eggman, and it immediately took the movie to a whole new level. no unnecessary human characters getting in the way like in the previous parts the story finally revolves around the main heroes! what i liked shadow. this character is just . they finally showed us his backstory, his motives, and his relationship with maria all of it was done so well that you actually start to empathize with him. hes not just a villain but a complex character whose development is fascinating to follow. jim carrey. no words needed the man absolutely nailed it. playing two roles at once is already a tough challenge, but he made them feel so distinct that i genuinely believed they were played by two different actors. the scenes where his characters interact especially the dance one were simply topnotch. the strongest part of the series. for me, this is the best sonic movie so far. the plot keeps you hooked, the pacing is great, and the characters are better developed than ever before. what didnt work the dialogues. this part was rough. it felt like they were written by ai stiff, unnatural, and strange. repetitive plot. this really hurt the overall impression. in the second movie, knuckles starts out as a villain, then talks with sonic and becomes his ally. and what do we see here? the exact same formula with shadow. writers, seriously? the humor between eggman and his grandfather. these scenes were pure cringe. i was sitting there feeling so awkward i just wanted to disappear. why was this even included? final thoughts sonic 3 is definitely a solid movie. 7 out of 10, because despite its flaws, it still holds its ground. shadow is the standout, jim carrey is phenomenal, but i really hope the next installments have a more original storyline. the big question now is whats next? shadow is peak material, and itll be hard to come up with someone better. if the creators dont step up their game with a fresh, compelling villain, the franchise risks losing steam. i hope that doesnt happen because sonic 3 showed just how much potential they have.",positive
"loved the first two but this is dire by any sequel standards. its just not remotely funny, its laboriously slow and meaningless. it is totally without any depth as well as light on any social comment for older audiences and i just cannot imagine it would appeal to any younger audiences that have started to think for themselves. if i could be bothered to look and see and waste more of my life on such a poor offering it would be be interesting to see if the same director and script writers were involved if yes then we can all have days, if not, it stands out a mile. not worth paying for, if you have to wait for freeview.",positive
"i must admit that i quite enjoyed the first film. not the best martial arts flick in the world, but by no means the worst. however, compared to this, its a damn masterpiece! 1 there are waaaaay too many characters. in the first, you had the four heroes cage, sonya, kang, and raiden, and about five villains kahn, kano, subzero, scorpion, and goro. this meant that at least some amount of time could be spent building on characters. thus, before we see sub zero,goro and scorpion fight, we know who they are , and their reputations. this doesnt happen with a single character in mka because it is too busy trying to throw as many characters from the games at you as possible that it often doesnt even have time to mention who they are e.g. smoke, cyrax, rain, baraka, mileena. 2 its had a 30 million budget, yet seems to have spent on completely the wrong things. i would have much rather they had halved their sfx budget and hired a decent fight choreographer. put it this way iron monkey cost less than 4 if i remember correctly for the entire film, and there isnt a single fight in mka that comes close to the worst in that film, which leads on to the next point. 3 the direction is terrible!! especially during the fights!!! watch any decent fight sequence, and generally the cuts are kept to a minimum. it both makes the fight easier to follow, and shows off the skill of the participants more. its rare in this film that any flow between moves occurs without cuts. during one move, there are actually about five cuts!! no cuts would have looked much better!! 4 its hard to decide which is worse, the script, or the acting. 5 the sfx heavy final battle is perhaps the lamest thing i have ever seen. there are people who will defend this film saying that its just fun!, or its not meant to be deep and meaningful or anything. which works for some films. and those films can be fun. or not deep and meaningful, but still enjoyable. this isnt. its bad. it hasnt got one redeeming feature that i can think of. possibly the worst film. ever.",positive
"being an indian i have seen a lot of bollywood movies which do not live upto international standards. 3 idiots is no different. its a masala movie, which will draw only mainstream and dumb folk. it might be attractive to the viewers outside as such experiences are new to them, however the truth is that this movie doesnt deserve any place in any top lists on imdb. im sure that the people who have given it a 1010 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. it was a major hit in indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. to be honest, for an indian movie id give it a 610 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5. if you want to watch a good indian movie, id recommend watching dev.d which i rate as an 810 and i feel should be on the top 250 list. make a wise decision",positive
"as many have said already, i also really wanted to like the movie, but at the end it is barely over average. the greatest sin that it suffers is the fact there is no tension for the entire time. i had nothing to cheer for since all the good guys were invincible. they casually strolled through the whole mission while shooting carelessly a bunch of nazis. when i say zero tension, i totally mean it. for example, they had to cut their mission short and it was supposed to be more risky, but we never saw that risk. they could have easily teleported to location as it didnt matter. whatever happened on screen i knew they were going to win. everyone in this movie was so onedimensional, so that took another reason for me to care much about what was going on the screen. good guys were good and bad guys were dumbevil and thats it! last sin for me was the music repetitive and absolutely uninspiring! compared to everything else that guy ritchie is directing, this had very bad soundtrack. i cant exactly describe it but, there was nothing memorable about it. overall, this felt like a movie that had to be made more than a move that inspired someone to make it. you can always tell when the director puts their heart into a project and this one was not it. its polished, it has good actors, good story, probably budget too, but the glue to put them all together wasnt there.",positive

"this movie has joined the list of movies considered the worst ever. to me a movie is bad if it is unengaging and without worth. i have seen way worse films. paris hilton is something of a guilty pleasure for me. i think shes matured from a tabloid it girl heiress to a mature young woman who knows the value of her name, and is focused on building her brand. she is every bit the businesswoman that kim kardashianwest only wishes she could be. this movie is an artifact of that transitioning period. i therefore consider myself to be more unprejudiced and openminded than others here. hindsight may also be a factor i am reviewing this in 2018. what we have here is a lighthearted, brainless adolescent romp. joel david moore is terrific as the lead. and paris acting isnt terrible, its just fine in fact a significant improvement over her bottoms up performance. an enjoyably trashy bmovie. it was after all shot in 5 weeks with a 9million budget and produced by paris hilton entertainment. at worst its corny and very average at best it has a little heart and charm. it is definitely nowhere near one of the worst films of all time. not even close.",negative

"mickey robert pattinson is desperate to avoid a grisly fate at the hands of a loan shark, so decides his best bet is to get offplanet. thing is, there are an whole load of likeminded folk so his only hope is to be an expendable. that means he gets used for all the dangerous and experimental tasks and if he gets killed or seriously maimed, they just lob him in the incinerator and reprint him complete with all his old and quite a few new memories. travelling through space, he meets nasha naomie ackie and they have a good thing going, even if the imperious couple in charge mark ruffalo and toni collette have forbidden the wasting of the 100 calories it takes to have sex! things start to go a bit wrong, though, when he unexpectedly survives one chilly mission only to find upon his return they have already duplicated his successor. nasha thinks the mnagetrois thing could work quite well but mickey less so, and when rumours of their duplicate existence starts to abound, well things get distinctly dodgy. meantime, the indigenous population of the planet they have landed on are getting a bit cross with the murderous attitudes of their human interlopers, and so perhaps its gonna be for mickey x 2 and nasha to sort things out before the pitch changes altogether. its quite good fun this, but i kept thinking of galaxy quest and couldnt decide if ruffalo was having a go at donald trump or val kilmer with his rather hammy performance. also, despite being easy enough on the eye, pattinson is a remarkably charmfree actor and here, even when there are some daft scenarios and the cgi works flat out to create a perfect series of images, he just underwhelmed the whole time and when the film is about more than one of him, that mattered. collette and steven yeun are relatively underused and its simply far too long to sustain the thinness of a plot that does raise some interesting issues around human cloning, exploration and that especially american cinematic trait of shooting extraterrestrials first and then asking question later, but i was disappointed with this, sorry.",positive
"this film is a treasure. two beautiful, vulnerable performances by hopkins and pryce. although not catholic, i have a love for the catholic church. when i saw this film on netflix, it caught my attention and i watched it and loved it. i then watched it again with my husband, who also loved it. at the time, i didnt even know it had some nominations for the oscars. those nominations are well deserved. this movie digs beneath the facade of formality and tradition and lets us see into the hearts a motivations of these two godly men. although it is mostly dialogue driven, it kept my attention all the way through. i loved the shots into the past for cardinal bergoglio. it really helped the viewer to understand him better. and i loved the subtle humor that hopkins brought to the role of pope benedict. i came away from this film with an affection for both main characters. i highly recommend it.",positive
"bullet train 2022 if brad pitt wasnt in this film, i would have never even bothered with it despite being familiar with the entire cast because ive had my share of disappointing action. the first 25 minutes didnt do the movie any favors as it looked like a cheap parody of pulp fiction with pretentious dialogue and excessive self indulgence. i began to contemplate if i was going to end up watching machete 3 based on the initial action, but then the plot began to get interesting, combat dialed up and the train took off. bullet train revolves around a bunch of assassins running after a highly prized briefcase that belongs to a crime boss named white death. additionally, every single killer on board has their own unique objective which ends up being derailed as new characters come into the picture. after the initial drag, the film turns into a highly dynamic ride of violence with bright colors, eccentric characters and cool choreography. while most of the cast fit their parts, i cant possibly understand what did joey king do to get the leading role. the eccentric nature of the film can feel excessive at times as half the edginess ends up being pure cringe i mean the whole thomas the train went from being a fun gimmick to an overbearing annoyance. the humor is split about 5050 depending on your sense of humor and the dialogue can be laughably stupid at times. nevertheless, all these negatives didnt ruin the overall fun experience that progressively dialed up the action while having a nice little element of whodunit with plenty of cameos. i also loved the subtle fiji advertising. naturally, brad pitt is the driving force behind this locomotive and he is highly enjoyable in the role of a chilled out assassin. not much to see in the cinema nowadays but this film was definitely worth the trip. movies.shmovies on instagram for honest movie and tv show reviews.",negative
"the release of tarantinos pulp fiction in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre the standard hallmarks serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour. the biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius stripstyle plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail. inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on tarantinos success, but it wasnt until 1998 when guy ritchie, an unknown british director, took on the challenge that a successor was found. now ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasnt a fluke. turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when hes not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers. through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one mickey oneil, a mumbling manic motormouthed piker who also happens to be a onepunch marvel. turkish persuades mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that mickey has his own agenda, and gets turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit. other characters that become involved in the drama include a fourfingered degenerate gamblerjewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed russian gun runner, a group of irish gypsies, a crooked new york jeweler and a pugnacious pet. the common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit. if you arent confused yet, you soon will be. lock, stock and two smoking barrels, mr. madonnas ritchie first film, was shot on a small budget, with a noname cast except for football bad boy vinnie jones and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad. while not a technically a sequel snatch is stylistically very similar to lock, stock ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance. he did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable think very bad things. what struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast. ritchie faced a daunting task with this film how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience? the feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars. somehow ritchie manages each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece. with so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out rade serbedzija is hilarious as the mad russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is vinnie jones manic gentleman hitman. on the other end of the spectrum, is alan ford as brick top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes coldblooded viciousness. if forced to pick my favorite however, i would have to go with brad pitt pitt resurrects his trailer trash look from kalifornia and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friends uncle wally on a bad day. as mickey oneil, the hard drinking wily grifter and parttime pugilist, pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor. and i would be remiss if i didnt mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in. while snatch initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to ritchies earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.",positive
"there didnt seem to be any wasted or unnecessary moments in this movie. each character and each scene had something significant to add. even the frequent could have been gratuitous sex scenes were kept short. they were just enough to move the story forward. each character even those that could have been shallow characatures added depth. the premise was absurd on the surface but that didnt matter. at one point about a third of the way in it gave me a touch of fellini. after being dragged to yet another marvel movie aquaman and then wonka this week, poor things was a delicious treat.",positive

"well, i have to be one of those people who simply hated this musical and really cannot see all the fuss over it, or ever why people think it should have won the oscar for best picture of that year. although it had some catchy tunes, and i guess the dancing was fine, it really didnt grab me. the plot was nearly nonexistent. i put it up there with easter parade, bandwagon, and finians rainbow as the most boring musicals. even though all of them have some wonderful tunes, none of them really do anything. though i fully understood the weak excuse of a plot dealing with the transition from vaudville, silent movies, then to talkies, i found that the actual plot was so thin it left me wanting, and it became nothing more than an excuse on which to hang some songs albeit some really catchy and lively ones. sadly, i find that to be the trouble with most movie musicals. there are no characters that develop at all. however, there are some that have really grabbed me seven brides for seven brothers, meet me in saint louis and yes, it hasnt got a strong plot either, but it hangs together far better than singing in the rainbrigadoon, showboat,wizard of oz, and a few like that. my favourite musical is fiddler on the roof. why it appeals to me is there is a real plot, and the music is not intrusive and doesnt stop the actual storyline. that is my biggest complaint with musicals is the way everything comes to a stop for the music oliver is one of the worst for this, and that usually the plot is so weak that well, were it not for the music there would be nothing whatever to watch. each performer did a masterful job in this movie, that i can admit. the choreography was well thought out especially anything that gene kelly danced, but of course, he did the choreography, so naturally what he designed for himself would be masterful. even the singing was quite good though i prefer more robust singing over kellys soft breathy crooning. and of course, the sets, costumes, and all that were wonderful. and the editing was well done. but even with all that going for it, it just left me cold and for the most part, bored. the only movie musical that bored me more was westside story. and again, it is a musical with some really great music, just far too long.",positive

"ok, i just had to see it, i dont know why, but you know how when you see a movie on the bottom 100, youre just so curious if the movie really is that bad? i remember back in 2001 how mariah carey was trying to so hard to be on top of the world, have a record and movie reach number 1 in one year, but everyone knew this was a typical movie where a pop star should just really stick to their day job. i dont know why mariah thought this was a good idea, its just so typical. now granted, i do believe this was a bad movie, but as far as bottom 100 goes... i dont think it was that extremely bad, its better than most pop star trying to be a movie star movies like in the cut. glitter is just poorly written and has bad actors in it, thats what makes it so unbearable to watch and makes mariah look incredibly desperate for everyones approval. billie frank was put into a foster home as a child when her mother lost the house to a fire, billie grows up and becomes a back up singer in a group. but when a local dj, dice, hears billies voice, he wants to get her to sing his songs and become a power house sensation in the music world. they engage in a romance together and everything seems to go well when she is finally exposed and then gets exploited. but of course it starts to get into the way of her and dices relationship and she begins to realize the pain and sacrifices she must make in order to make it big. glitter is just a cheesy movie, it doesnt do any harm, thats the reason for the merciful rating im giving it. but im just really surprised by terrence howard who is an incredible actor and he did this crummy movie. but then again we have al pacino in gigli, its one of those scary stories of life where if the money is good, what the heck, lets get the big star in it. mariah looked so uncomfortable on camera and did a horrible job of acting. i feel bad because im just complaining so much about this movie, but if youre looking for a cheesy movie, id recommend glitter, but its torture on the brain, it made mine hurt thats for sure when i thought of all the money that was wasted on this box office flop. 210",negative

"in nathan for you, the comedian nathan fielder poses as a business consultant to aid various struggling commercial enterprises and organizations. the approaches he proposes to solve their problems in a competitive market are creative and inventive but strange, sometimes to an extreme degree. despite initial opposition or scepticism, he is given a chance to demonstrate the viability and utility of his schemes, a task that often leads him down long protracted rabbit holes as they are rarely straightforward to implement. by hook or by crook, he is typically able to achieve some success in his results with the whole process being captured on film. nathan for you, to me, was very much an acquired taste. not being a lover of cringe or awkward comedy, the initial episodes had me perceiving the show to be rather meanspirited with its humour based on lampooning the gullibility of small business owners. but as i watched more and pondered further, it became clearer that the series instead satirized consulting practices, showing how claiming expertise could permit one to propound and execute absurd ideas by presenting them as solutions to specified challenges. the butt of the jokes werent the business owners, nor the seeminglyaggrieved customers, but nathan the consultant himself! this realization was instrumental in enabling me to appreciate and enjoy the show more. a few of the episodes still rode the line of what i felt acceptable but at many moments, i found myself unconsciously laughing out loud. i came to love the deadpan awkward personality nathan portrayed, the attention to detail in the elaborate plans required to realize the proposed solutions, the recurring side characters with their inputs and insights, and the blurring of the line between reality television and scripted comedy. i also loved that there were real emotional moments as well as profound thoughtprovoking reflections to be found within some episodes. all together, these elements combined together to make nathan for you a unique enthralling experience and one of my favourite comedy shows in the awkward humour genre.",positive

"i must now shamefully admit that as a self proclaimed lover of movies,that this is in fact the first charlie chaplin film i have viewed from start to finish.i had always been aware of the genius of chaplin,and had seen him in bits and pieces over the years,but had never viewed a piece of his work in its entirety.modern times made a tremendous impression on me.chaplins knack for physical comedy was nothing short of impressive,and his talent did not stop there.in modern times,he not only displays that area of his genius,there is romance and a genuine tear jerking sweetness to his character,the little tramp that he no doubt displayed in the other films in which he portrayed the character,which i plan to view in the future.another thing i admire about this film was that it was 1936.sound had long been incorporated into films by then,yet chaplin was still displaying his silent magic here,though it isnt completely silent.chaplin placed sound where he felt it was needed,and even the way he did that was nothing short of genius.if there were a mount rushmore for comedians,charlie chaplin would indeed have a prominent place on it.",positive

"sea world is under siege from the great white monster, thats basically the entire plot, throw on the kids from jaws 1 all grown up rather quickly, some cute dolphins, some horrific 3d effects, and a hugely camp performance from simon maccorkindale and you have a film. you need to be watching it in 3d or it looks horrific, the effects are bad enough as it is, without 3d they look shocking, floating limbs and fish heads etc. i liked the opening scenes with the music and the dead fish etc. quite atmospheric i guess, i think by now though the jaws franchise is looking very very tired, jaws 2 was a fairly decent sequel, but they should have stopped there. the film definitely misses roy schneider who was the focal character apart from the shark of course. its definitely better then jaws the revenge which is an absolute waste of time. in shark terms this film would be a basking shark, it certainly lacks any bite of any kind. its a film you watch for a bit of fun, its hard to take this one seriously. 410",negative

"ive just left the theater and i have to say this movie left me with nothing compelling. it felt like it was trying to go into this deep, emotional realm, but when it was right on the precipice, it released the tension and backed off. im a big fan of peoplefocused movies where the point is character development, but this just lacked all the elements that make a good, characterdriven film. kieran culkins character has some genuine, intriguing moments, but unfortunately he goes nowhere. i desperately wanted the two main characters to truly connect and understand each other on a deeper level, but in the moments where i thought they might it just fizzled into nothingness. it was an utter disappointment to see the movie start and end in the exact same way, the characters seeming to learn nothing about each others ways of life and taking nothing to heart. this movie could have done so much more to make these emotional topics really hit home with the audience, but between the often stilted or confusing dialogue, slow pacing, and lack of clear momentum, it just went nowhere. it had the elements for a good story and a revelatory payoff at the end, but at every turn it fumbled and refused to go to a deeper level, despite clearly wanting to. there were multiple moments in this movie where i thought it would finally take a turn, and these characters would really connect, but it just didnt happen. i think the better version of this movie with similar themes is everything is illuminated. stay home and watch that and know for a fact that its much better than this film. overall, it was slow with a total lack of direction and no payoff. i left feeling and thinking nothing different, just that i wasted my time and money.",positive
"wow. i just watched this film on tv. i didnt pay to see it in theaters, although i am considering filing a lawsuit against my cable company for mental anguish. a friend and i decided to watch it on a whim and as the credits rolled my friend asked who wrote it, to which i replied you know, its not always the writers fault. this is true is is not always the writer who messes up a story. but in this case it is very much the writers fault. our story follows patience as she goes from lovable shy girl to catwoman. i use the capitals in the word cat because the writers seemed to feel the need to impress upon the audience at every possible turn that she is now a catwoman. i got the feeling that our trio of wouldbe poets would have preferred to stand in theaters with baseball bats labeled catwoman which they would swing at any member of the audience who didnt seem to appreciate the blatant cat references and mannerisms of ms. berry while screaming get it? shes a cat! isnt that cool??? shes a cat! if they had been given the opportunity. the catbat is swung so often in this movie i began to feel the need for a catchers mask. the story is poorly thought out and the plot seems merely designed to let us see halle in the leather suit a few times to distract us from considering the money wasted making this piece of litter. oh and not to spoil things but the police in the movie are morons of the highest caliber. when presented with clues in the form of a used glass with dna, fingerprints which were all over the jewelry store, or some lipstick? if you said fingerprints youd be wrong, just as wrong as this movie.",negative

"the film itself contained a good plot one that could be done over various times yet would never lose its appeal. the concept of someones destiny changing, career and lovewise, is highly entertaining because of the succession of events that lead up to the final scene. however with the presence of jolie it makes it more interesting because her personality shines through one that is definitely unique and honest. the only problem i had with the film was the lack of an emotional connection between the two main characters. im not sure if this was because of onset difficulties between the actors or whether it was intended by the director in which case, that was poor judgment. nevertheless, it was entertaining and comical particularly the satisfaction scene. that was original and very... satisfying.",negative

"here is my review in short. do not see this film. it sucks worse than fifty shades of grey.. which is an absolute trainwreck. i didnt pay, but feel bad for giving any of my time to the film and as well as being unfunny it is incredibly boring, racist and horrendus. i chuckled about twice and one of those times was coz fifty shades of grey was read as a torture technique.. so well played. there was a skit involving whiplash which may have been bearable on snl but not here. all i will say is save your time and oxygen. go and be with your family, be anywhere but here. quite frankly i saw 10 cloverfield lane today and id rather talk about that so.. see ya.",negative
"the film is stunningly beautiful, ive read about the amount of humanhours invested in this film, and those people, indeed, deserve an oscar. however, on the other side linear and onesided characters, which are not properly introduced, and i still doubt, why some of them were in the film. like, if you remove them nothing will change. the last thing to say i belive the film is overvalued. yes, it is beautiful, new generation, so to say, but, i cant agree that this film has the right to stay in line with one of the best films in the world. it is always easier to draw a cartoon full of emotions than to show emotions of a real person.",positive
"i watched this movie right after how to lose a guy in 10 days and it made it very clear that they are really trying to move away from the classic romcom format of yore, for the better. yes, there is still a fair amount that is predictable but i wouldnt necessarily say its formulaic. there is plenty of originality in the script and especially the tone and how the characters are written, and i had a few genuine laughs. also, ive never really been a fan of jennifer lawrence but i have to admit that she is doing a great job here. so i would definitely recommend it as something light and entertaining, which is really what i needed right now.",positive

"city lights is without exception the most romantic film ever made. what can be more perfectly idyllic and altruistically beautiful than a movie about a bighearted tramp charlie chaplin who falls for a blind flower girl and tries in vain to raise money for an eye operation. the tramp does so by depending on the largess of a carousing millionaire whose drunken debauchery at one point convinces the girl virginia cherrill that the tramp is infact a wealthy benefactor and not just a homeless tramp eager to find love. effortlessly funny in the way that only charlie chaplin can achieve, city lights has the audacity to once again give voice to the voiceless while being a treasure trove of timeless comedic scenes. theres something about chaplins unabashed humanism and sincere romanticism that strikes a cord that willing audiences wont soon forget. while the best of films can make you jump for joy or shed a tear, city lights and the genius of chaplin can accomplish both within the same reel. while some may not be keen on silent films, chaplins tramp persona has achieved cinematic immortality through his universal appeal as a struggling but always chipper, limber and silent vaudevillian. his comedy of romance and pantomime may just stand the test of time better than any of his films, which is saying a lot since most of his feature films are not just good but visually nearperfect.",positive

"saving christmas would be nothing more than another bad movie, but this one tries to touch on the subject of christianity related to christmas and does it pretty badly. its surprising that a man of faith like kirk cameron would have done something like this, since that must surely make him a lousy evangelist. what is salvageable is the soundtrack and some of the scenes that kirk is narrating since they are worthy of a music video. the story is too short and the conflict is resolved at once, but there is a lot of filler and a lot of slow motion so that the film lasts longer. it pretends to be a comedy, but its not funny. it also has many historical errors that are difficult to take seriously and it is not understood if kirk wanted to give a metaphorical meaning to the christmas things that he considers christian. its not the worst movie ive seen, but its a bad movie and thats why i give it a 310.",negative

"ive been a big supporter of writerdirector tom six and his taboobusting human centipede films since the beginning i rated the first film 810, and gave the jawdroppingly twisted sequel 910. the only reason i didnt give part two full marks was because i believed that six still had a few tricks up his sleeve and would probably surpass himself with his third film. as it happens, i was wrong. as far as the controversial content is concerned, the film delivers numerous scenes that live up to sixs notorious reputation, kicking off with some sexual abuse, before proceeding to serve up such sordid treats as the torture of a prisoner with pans of boiling water, a nauseating castration scene, the insertion of a gun barrel into a mans stoma, the consumption of human testicles and dried clitorises, some woundrape and comarape, and, of course, the creation of not just the biggest human centipede yet, but also a human caterpillar, the surgical process for both depicted in graphic detail. but while the film doesnt wimp out on the deviancy, it does suffer from two major problems that make it a very unsatisfying experience overall. the first is the prison setting, which is so implausible that it renders the whole movie utterly ridiculous. the first two films, while unlikely, were at least vaguely plausible it was possible to believe that a raving lunatic might try to stitch a few folks asstomouth out of curiosity, but the notion that the head of a large correctional facility could do the same, with the cooperation of his staff, is absurd in the extreme and seriously detracts from the films overall effectiveness as a shocker. even when viewed as a black comedy, its still a dumb premise. the second issue i have is with dieter laser the actor who played dr. heiter in the first film his performance as sadistic warden bill boss is hugely irritating, the guy drawing out every single syllable at the top of his voice to the point where i would have liked to have seen his mouth sewn to someones ass just to shut him up. laurence harvey bugeyed star of the second film is also crap, but at least hes not quite as annoying. both guys are outacted by pornstar bree olson, who is also a whole lot easier on the eyes. if the subtitle final sequence is to be believed, this film sees an end to the human centipede series its a hugely disappointing way to wrap things up. lets hope that sixs next film sees the director back on form we need something to flush away any memories of this rather obnoxious mess.",negative
"i do love both pryce and hopkins. accomplished actors at the top of their game. and it certainly shows in this film. long rambling dialogue, yet it never drags nor becomes boring. so definitely watch, you will not be disappointed. my problem with the film is the reasons presented why pope benedict xvi resigned. the level of scandalmismanagement were far greater than suggested. it doesnt not completely make sense that benedict left only for the good of the church and there was no pressure for him to leave. victims of abuse were coming forward in country after country. not to mention the substantial financial problems with the vatican bank. the church had to do something radical. i highly doubt is was only benedicts conscience that resulted in his resignation. so watch, but take this reality with a grain of salt.",positive

"lee unkrinch directed toy story 3, the third and presumably final installment in the toy story movie franchise. one could argue that this is probably the best one yet 1999s toy story 2 remains my personal favorite of the three, and i wont argue with those who think otherwise. i still hold onto toy story 2 for deep personal reasons, but toy story 3 does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch a rarity in animated films these days. as foreshadowed in toy story 2, andy john morris has finally grown up hes 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. his mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic a sort of gonebutnotforgottenandwithinreachtype of deal. woody tom hanks, brave leader of the toys and andys favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when buzz lightyear tim allen and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at sunnyside daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. this introduces us to lotso ned beatty, the strawberryscented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metrosexual ken doll michael keaton and others. as it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and lotso runs this place with an iron fist of course, lotso has a very tragic backstory that explains his evil ways, much like with jessie joan cusack, who first appeared in toy story 2. so woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college. toy story 3 is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first toy story, which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented disneyowned animation studio pixar. they have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. the animation here is at its most lifelike and real and its damnnear flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with toy story. and every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories. while toy story 2 had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, toy story 3 is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. there are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. in addition, toy story 3 can also be an incredibly dark film at times a bold move considering that this is a family film but theres no need to worry because the fact is that its all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very lighthearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes. toy story 3 is a triumph of animation and imagination, and i say that as a diehard toy story 2 fan. what we get here, is a fitting closer ? to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. its just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone byebye. 1010",positive

"some like it hot is a truly delightful and hilarious comedy, complete with brilliant performances and great writing. this is the sort of comedy that has the desire of sex as part of the plot, and while there have been films that have ignored this, this film embraces it to stellar effect. the plot is brilliant in construction and almost elaborate, about two men escape after witnessing a mob fight, and join an all female band disguised as women, and this is where the film gets complicated. the direction from billy wilder is spot on, the cinematography is beautiful and the music is gorgeous. other than the performances, the real treasure comes in the script, a mother load of classically delicious lines that are not only funny but intelligent as well. the performances are note perfect, while tony curtis and jack curtis give truly wonderful performances, it is the beautiful marilyn monroe in a deliciously seductive and sly performance who steals the acting honours. all in all, a truly wonderful comedy, right up there with comedies like duck soup and night at the opera as one of the best comedies of all time. 1010 bethany cox",positive
"the move itself is pretty well made. but the movie itself is too grotesque. the movie is very strange about music there are several scenes that desperately need soundtrack, and the movie gets boring as a result occasionally. theres a very strange toneplot shift. the first half of the movie is uncomfortable sex and drugs nearly every scene, and the second half is a meandering wander of characters fighting. the dialogue can be quite clever, and the characters themselves are quite good. the film goes about confronting prejudice in an interesting thematic manner. it could be quite a good movie, but it is just too graphic. sure, the movie is about how people are people and its great thematically, but you dont want to see all the things people do either. all the characters are pretty believable. for some reason, most of the characters are overthetop horrible and cruel.",positive
"most of what happens in the movie is totally unbelievable, but realism isnt the point. its a fairy tale that shines through the way it is told for example the outstanding cinematography, transitioning from the beautiful scenery of the first part to the bleak setting of the death camp and of course the iconic music that deservedly won an oscar and mostly the power of its message. hope can break into the darkest corners of the world. if you dont have any guns, you can fight with humour, imagination and, above all, love. any life is beautiful as long as theres love in it and here we witness one of its purest and most touching forms, the love of a father for his son. another asset of the movie, arguably its biggest one, is its emotional range. many people compare roberto benignis performance to charlie chaplin and its easy to why, as he masterfully balances between comedy and tragedy, laughter and tears by the way, his prisoner number is a tribute to the great dictator. this dualism makes the dramatic moments even more intense, nostalgia of the good times makes a dire situation even more hopeless. on a final note, i dont understand why anyone would find it offensive or insulting, the atrocities of the holocaust come through as clearly as in any other movie with a similar subject matter.",positive

"not even ed wood himself could have made a more amateuristic film than what superman 4 turned out to be. worst bluescreen effects ever superman just seems like a blueishgreenishreddish cardboard cutout sliding over the screen sideways much like the terry gilliam cutouts from monty python but here its not meant to be funny i think. gene hackmans lex luthor is nothing more then a clownesque nobody assisted by his slick greaser highschool nephew. supermans nemesis nuclear man created from supermans dna turns out to be a 80s hairmetal neanderthal in spandex whos lines of dialogue consist mainly of arrrghh. compared to modern day superman this one looks like a pyjama wearing nerd with his oversized red underwear on the outside with matching plastic boots. im sure he wouldnt draw any attention in a gay bar. they always say films are made in the cutting room but here the editor must have shaken his head and thought there was nothing to be saved. dont get me started on the plot christopher reeve cowrote the story...probably when he was high on lsd or something. spoiler at a certain point in the film superman gets rid of all the nukes in the world by plucking them out of the sky, gathering them in a giant ball and swinging them into the sun. also people can breathe in space. this film is just a disaster of epic proportions and you really have to see it to believe it. im sure this is used in film schools around the world as reference material on how not to make a film.",negative

"charles chaplin is an acclaimed silent film actor, but you would not be able to tell that from this film. there is plenty of speaking to go around, and it is done quite well for a man who mostly resided in silent films. from an entertainment aspect, the film is sometimes boring, but it is very funny. i did find myself chuckling quite often at what was going on, but overall the entertainment side was lacking. but these 7 stars come from everything else this film brings. at the time, the us had not yet entered wwii. however, 1940 is when hitler was gaining traction, and his ideas and beliefs spreading throughout the world. this film is a direct parody of everything him and his regime stood for, and that is a bold move. such blatantly obvious criticism of a political party and regime nowadays would seem almost inconceivable. but chaplin did it. the speech that the jewish barber delivers at the end is perfect. i dont mean like, yea its perfectly place. i mean that every single word in that speech is perfect. the speech itself is quite pertinent in todays society as well im writing this on november 17, 2020 and stood the test of time for 80 years. a beautiful criticism of hatred and a wonderful plea for love and peace.",positive

"wildly, absolutely, and unapologetically shameless i always become furious watching relevant tv these days. glee, vampire diaries, jersey shore its all crap to me. i dont care about your drama music club, i dont want to know how brooding, love sick vampires get girlfriends, and i definitely dont care about how many stds snooki has gotten over the past several years. look at where we all are, we are in a recession, schools and public works maintenance funding is in the tank, rich get richer, poor die young young, the public representation in government is nearly zip, and etc. so why is popular tv sunshine and rainbows, fake, expensive tans, and rich white kids with some of other ethnicity to have some scope in minority television ratings singing? heres the deal i dont enjoy high school, i hate twilight, and i dont like to date stupid alcoholics. i want a show about life, real life, as it is for the majority of this now crazy and defunct america. i wanted shameless. shameless is shotime original drama series that centers on the dysfunctional family of single father, dead beat, and alcoholic frank gallagher, played by oscar nominee william h. macy. while at first glance the gallaghers everyday grind of trying to get through the day living below the poverty line in chicago may come across as just another crass, american, and unrated, comedy series. and it is. frank and his kin are constantly landing themselves in crazy stranger than fiction circumstances which are an absolute thrill to view. from scamming thugs to pay bills to shooting yourself in the hand with a nail gun to keep getting disability checks, the gallaghers know how to party. at the same time though, the comedy is also a great false pretense that i works very well in the shows favor. as soon you become hooked to the offbeat and racy humor you very soon start to see the very real stories that the actors flawlessly bring to the small screen with their performances. lipjeremy allen white, the oldest son in the gallagher family, is a certifiable genius but is at odds with whether or not he is content living the way he has and could more than likely end up like his loser father, frank. the other biggest plot line is that of fionaemmy rossum, the eldest daughter, who has to choose between her own happiness or keeping up with her supposed obligations to provide for her family since their mother ran out on them several years ago. and while the gallaghers are a dysfunctional family, its easy to sometimes watch in awe as they are able to still pull together at the end of the day, despite everything, and enjoy life. this show may turn some off though, that is expected. we all enjoy different spectrums of life that we make ourselves want to believe in. but as for those of us living in this country and finding ourselves not quite getting sucked in by glee or whatever, this is a godsend. people like us want what is real, what is willing to show us the grittiness of society. but show all of it, the good and bad. not all of us can drive beetles or hummers and go drinking on the boats our parents buy us. some of us have to worry about real life right now, probably more than we care to admit. and thats what shameless is about, being more real than we care to admit. the first season is now on dvd and bluray, and the shows second season is now on tv, pulling no punches as expected. it looks like my winterspring is going to be one well spent with the gallagher family. although, i think i might tune in once or twice to jersey shore to watch snooki drunkenly run head first into a wall.",negative

"old sea maps used to leave a warning on the outer edges of the charts. it would read here be monsters. i wish such a message had been written before the opening credits. oh, actually it was, but it was in code that i deciphered too late to save myself. it was the part which read 3 ninjas high noon at mega mountain. woe! woe unto me!!!! im a man with, admittedly, unusual and quirky tastes when it comes to film and film actorsactresses. i like a lot of character actors because they tend to get the most interesting variety of parts. i really loved victor wongs career. memories of his performances in films like tremors, prince of darkness, and especially big trouble in little china with another favourite of mine, al leong the wing kong hatchet man!!! lol have put me on a quest to see as much of his work as possible. a quest that died saturday afternoon just past. this deeply regrettable, dreckish, foul excuse of a film and the knowledge that victor wong appeared in three other incarnations of it is enough to sour even the strongest moviegoers stomach. victors appearance in this awful thing is mercifully concentrated in the opening of the film. it gives him no chance to show off any of his inimitable charm and victor wong looks like a tired old man weighed down by the two hardest words that any actor will ever have to listen to contractual obligation. music insipid. direction insipid. plot insipid. dialogue insipid. acting hit and miss. the kids all deserved better than to be stuck in this film. for fear that they will track me down and beat the heck out of me with their ninja skills, just let me say that they all gave academy award worthy performances. exhibit a the two younger brothers manage to keep a straight face and wait holding their fight stance for thirty seconds as the three bad guy adults struggle to get out of their costumes and dress up again so that the kids can yell ninjas!!! i dont blame the kids for this despite the fact that they were as unwatchable as everything else here. this film will bore parents to death so unless you want orphans, avoid, avoid, avoid!!! victor wong let me return to a bright light for a moment died after this film. jim varney, who also appeared in this film, has also since died. you may draw your own conclusions. varney, in all fairness, is probably the best thing in this film. his performance takes him in a scenestealing direction with a bad guy turn. outacting loni anderson, hulk hogan and all three ninjas, he easily comes across as a bully who is picking an acting fight with unarmed opponents ... i said i wasnt going to blame the kids... this wasnt their fault, this wasnt their fault ... final verdict unwatchable... bearable only for those who are diehard wong or varney fans. also bearable if one chants over and over again the words this too shall pass. all others should give a miss with extreme prejudice.",negative

"i am willing to bet that most of the bad reviews here are just getting their knickers in a twist about the fact that the story takes place at a gay wedding. and that people are having sex before marriage. when people say it tries too hard to be modern, thats just code for someones gay or someones having sex for fun, whether theyre consciously aware of their bigotry or not. ive seen the same type of review on countless hallmark movies where there were either gay couples involved or gasp! someone had sex before marriage. as for the film itself, i actually found this a much more believable enemiestolovers than that trope usually is because they already initially liked each other. they just had a misunderstanding or three. yeah, there are some cringe moments but also some laughoutloud funny ones. theres a cute australian shepherd the dog breed, not a human shepherd. plus, the cast includes awesome folks like michelle hurd, rachel griffiths, and dermot mulroney! just enjoy yourself and learn to be okay with people who maybe arent exactly the same as you. your world will be richer for it.",positive
"the fourth superman film was an incredible downgrade from the rest of the series, even the maligned superman iii, christopher reeve only returned because cannon films gave him an offer he couldnt refuse story input and produce any film he wanted. what hampered superman iv was its budget being halved just before production, making it look very cheap with the filmmakers having to reuse the same special effects shot and the action coming off as really laboured. it was only 90 minutes long, making it the shortest liveaction superman film and that it had to rush through its third act. its a far cry from the heights of the first two films",negative
"the first 10 minutes are great and heartfelt, but the rest of the movie is just standard kiddieanimatedactionmovie fare, but without any really funny gags or interesting or quirky characters. it seems for a lot of people the central premisemoral of the story touches a nerve, but that one idea alone isnt enough to lift the movie above an average rating. the animation is very good, as one has come to expect from pixar, but sorry, the bar has been raised in 2009 this level of quality has become the norm, i.e. average. the character development is good for carl fredricksen, but lacks depth for russell and also for charles munts. carl is really the only person in the movie who you kind of get attached to, but again, mainly due to the first 10 minutes montage of his life. the movie doesnt contain a lot of humour the one it does have seems forced and silly dog voice collars, the bird swallowing carls walking stick, etc. yawn. this movie is nowhere near the league of pixar greats ranging from toy story to walle. for other studios this might be considered good, but for pixar i would consider it average at best.",positive

"shocking and terrorizing is right. i dont even know where to begin. all i can say is it has the worst editing, worst sound, worst acting, worst directing, worst special effects, worst story, and worst ending ever told. however it is by far the most breathtaking failure ive ever seen. its like watching a work of art by picasso created with dog poop and vomit under sewage water. maybe thats what makes it fun to watch because of its honesty in trying to make a horror film with very limited resources. the pacing is atrocious though in that you will finally see the birds attack about 45 minutes through the movie and the birds look like windows 95 screen savers. the sound editing...its like every shot you will hear the difference in the background noise and by the time you see them firing guns your ears will explode due to the intensity of the sound. forget about the plot because it doesnt even need one. all in all i can say its a great movie to laugh at even when you are not drunk.",negative
"this is definitely one of the best shows, along with avenue 5 avenue 5 is my absolute favorite. the cast in this show is great, and its very watchable. i know nobody probably reads my reviews, but i rate things based on how much they make me want to sit and watch it, and this definitely did that just like avenue 5 and others like the sopranos, the wire, oz, etc. ill literally watching anything as long as it makes me want to sit through the whole thing. the best hbo can do imo, is to keep the high quality shows like this coming, and keep fresh blockbusters coming on saturdays its literally why i keep my 15month hbo subscription. the new release saturday movies have been kinda cheap lately, or ive seen them already, however, but maybe thats what hbo is making cinemax into, since they seem to have as many big budget new movies than hbo if not more. hbo might be returning to its glory days.",positive
"working as something of a cross between the kings speech and a man for all seasons, the two popes provides an intimate look at the interaction of popes benedict and francis how their theologicalpolitical differences were overcome to form a lasting friendship. the catholic faithful should be especially pleased with the final result as the film humanizes both men while providing a nice sermon about forgiveness and reconciliation. hopkins and pryce are superb in this film and much of the joy of it comes from their performances. the film does have a couple of large issues that i imagine will turn off any viewer not inclined to be charitable towards the film or the catholic church. meirelles does his acid cam psuedodocumentary style here and it really doesnt fit. this stuff works so well in gritty thrillers but in a theological qua political fight qua buddy film involving 80 year old men it feels very out of place. it is distracting to a fault and my biggest issue with the film. second the script is uninterested in exploring the priest abuse scandal in any detail worse at a key moment the film purposely distances the viewer from the lived reality. i think this choice was made to keep the tone more in the buddy odd couple dynamic but it does reality a disservice. but in the end this was a very entertaining film which is surprising given the subject matter.",positive

"is there life after playtime? can you handle a film in which the toys are playing with us, the audience? the third chapter of the toy story saga asks some tough questions of viewers, but the rewards of seeing this remarkable film outweigh the emotional toll. its the last week of summer before andy heads off to college, and woody tom hanks and the other remaining toys in andys bedroom find themselves in fear of whats to become of them. it looks like the attic, but events conspire to throw them a daycare center called sunnyside. it looks swell enough, at first... youll never be outgrown, or neglected, the toys are informed by the chuckily plush play bear lotso ned beatty. never abandoned or forgotten. no owners means no heartbreak! its odd to see a film series that started out as an animated lark turn into watership down, but theres always been some existential angst at the heart of the enterprise, c.f. the fragile buddy system employed in the first toy story, sids hapless victims, and talk of rummage sales. the second film pushed these buttons a bit harder, to the point of losing the humor. this time the drama is stronger than ever, yet the film amazingly manages to stay refreshingly clever and hilarious. we meet ken michael keaton, who introduces himself to barbie saying we were made for each other. ken must deal with wisecracks about being a girls toy, or as mr. potato head don rickles puts it, an accessory, a purse with legs. the daycare center is also fabulously realized, a cacophony of misfit toys all showing signs of wear from constant play. every now and again we break away to see woody in his new situation, being played with by a girl named bonnie who is very nice but has a leftfield imagination. we do a lot of improv here, another toy tells him. all this is very funny, and director lee unkrich and the pixar writers and artists find brilliant ways to keep humor close to the center of things throughout. yet this movie is no lark. one of the funniest scenes the first time i saw this movie three weeks ago, involving a cutaway to a clown staring at a window, got hardly a laugh when i saw it again tonight. i think it was because the rest of the audience, like me, knew what was coming a sad story about cosmic indifference and coldhearted abandonment which sets in motion the real emotional undertow of the film. set against this is woodys firm if shaken resolution to be there for andy, even when it seems he and the other toys are no longer wanted by their owner. its a message of faith you relate to, yet it also brings out another point, the notion of change, even painful change, as needful. the toys know theyll be neglected, perhaps forever, if exiled to the attic, but prefer it to the unknown. this actually makes sense. what can happen out there isnt very nice, but even in the face of extinction the film suggests a certain nobility through acceptance can be still possible. its a pretty heavy message to take away from watching a grated comedy. the film doesnt leave you on a down note, but its a funny thing. in the past, i always looked forward to the postcredit goof scenes as something to laugh at on my way out of the theater. this time, i appreciated it just as much as a chance to wipe my eyes before i got out of my chair. it still felt good, though.",positive
"there are lots of reviews about spy kids on here that are obviously written i suppose by adult movie buffs who criticice just about everything about it from an adult point of view. come on people, this movie was made for kids not for you! a rating of 3.4 is grossly unfair to the producers and the director and everyone who helped make a great movie for undertenyearolds. ok, it isnt the greatest kids film of all time but it is certainly worth more than that! i didnt have the benefit of 4d or even 3d at home and so i can only imagine how exciting it would have been on the big screen with all the latest technology thrown in. but i will happily watch it again with my grandkids and ill bet they will give it more than 3.4! from an adult pointofview, i thought ricky gervais as argonaut the dog was very funny which, in itself was good because it just goes to show how funny he can be without needing to resort to profanity. i was very tempted to give spy kids a 10 out of 10 just to drag the average up a bit but then i figured one vote isnt going to make that much difference so i gave it what i really thought it was worth a 6 but then maybe i should have waited for my grandkids to tell me what they think its worth. im looking forward to sharing it with them.",negative

"i dont know, up is very, very good, but i dont think its quite great. of all the pixar movies up to and including toy story 3, id say the only movies i like less than up are a bugs life and cars the latter of which is easily the worst. but the third worst movie of pixars first 15 years is still a very good movie, which i think really speaks to how great their initial run of movies was. i think what holds it back a little for me is that i dont find it as emotional or moving as most people. i can appreciate the opening is sad, but its never really moved me or made me personally sad, which is strange, because the tearjerker pixar scenes usually get to me like the jessie flashback in toy story 2, the opening of finding nemo, and all the stuff intended to be sad in inside out. other minor flaws? i think the villain is a bit weak. he has little to no redeeming or understandable qualities, beyond hes crazy because hes been stuck in the jungle for 60 years. the way he comes across as okay and then reveals himself to be villainous like three minutes later just feels so awkward to me. also, while i appreciate the music and the way that main theme changes throughout, i dont really like the theme to start with. i find it kind of grating, even if it technically and thematically works. where this movie does shine is in the animation, the humour, and the bond that forms between the two main characters. all the stuff with the dogs is great, too i know thats the part of the movie thats most obviously aimed at the kids in the audience, but its still the part of the movie i love the most. the story is told well, and the voice acting is all good too. i just dont find it as moving as most pixar films, i think the villain is a bit weak, and i think it has one of my least favourite music scores of any pixar movie. but its still good its solid and entertaining, just not quite great, in my opinion.",positive
"the movie is perfect to share popcorn in a rainy evening. ranking is always about what you expect for and for sure this is not an epic movie, but you can see a good hand behind. they want to save us from dull presentations and make action talk to itself. this makes the movie plenty of moments you wanted to know more... but too slippery that the feeling always goes to the next step. conclussion things happen, whatever... characters or scenes are not deep enough to stay and feels like a another excellent opportunity lost to beg for more. the result is a enjoyable and well made movie than ends and it is done. no desire for another sequel, no need to continue the story, not necessary to pass again for that moment just happens, touch a smile and go. recomend it. and have fun!",negative
"the real purpose of a movie is to entertain escapism to distance you from your problems for a short period of time. if you will look at this movie from the perspective of a person viewing movies for entertainment purposes, then this movie is good not very good since there are a lot of better escapist movies out there. if you look at it from the perspective of a movie critic, then this is a horrible movie, filled with clichs and poop jokes. the first film of this franchise may have had some clich plot points, but it didnt rely on poop and fart jokes to move the story or try to make the viewer laugh. this movie has the usual stepdaughterhatesstepmom and the geeky brother story lines along with the happily ever after ending. it seems the movie thinks that watching these story lines is entertaining to kids, when in fact, its not speaking from my perspective as a 13 year old kid. to be frank, its quite annoying. however, this movie doesnt lack on the entertainment value. cgi allaround, gadgets everywhere, this movie has tons of cool stuff to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat. there are jokes that if you watch first may seem funny, but in the end will make you think is that joke really funny, or is it offensive. bottomline is, this movie can be good or bad, depending on your perspective. to me, its escapism at its finest.",negative

"i started watching this cinematic abortion on netflix after 2012, a much better movie about the world ending. you see, im on a bit of an apocalyptic kick considering the subject is less depressing than the tragedy that is the united states right now, under the tangerine idiot. anyway, the whole reason i did was that i was under the impression it was going to be like a twilight zonetype movie, and with someone like nicholas cage in it, i figured it couldnt be horrendous. im surprised i got as far into it as i did, although after working for more than half a decade in a contact centre, my patience level is pretty high. the story is crap, the writing is crap, the acting is crap, and if this is the kind of crapola nick cage is taking on, he should retire forever. lea thompson could have made it the rest of her life on lorraine mcfly money without doing this piece of trash. i didnt pay anything other than my subscription to netflix for this, but somehow i feel utterly raped of my time and actually feel slightly dumber than i was, and should be monetarily compensated for my loss. at least this film did help me understand one thing. this is the reason trump is president. it now makes more sense to me that people actually put him into the position of power, now that i know that people actually created this and worse, people actually watched and enjoyed it. i think a petition needs to be started to have the title of this film officially changed to just vomit noise",negative

"well its hard to ignore that this looked like driving miss daisy with the races of the characters reversed. it was also hard to ignore that peter farrelly along with his brother, is normally known for bringing often crude comedy films. while green book does have a ton of humor it was definitely a step in a different direction and a true story to adapt at that. im amazed at how much i liked this film. every minute of this film is thoroughly enjoyable and it touches on every emotion. the film is about a loud mouth italian american named tony lip who gets a job driving and being protection for a jazz pianist named don shirley. initially, it is seen that the two come from different worlds and are at odds with each other but as time goes on and the two realize how different race relations are in the south, they begin to bond and become closer than they expected they would. starring viggo mortensen and mahershala ali in the title roles. the film has a lot of laugh out loud moments. especially through the eccentric nature of both leads. whether its tonys hard headed but uncultured nature or dons particularities , the chemistry between the two is really off the charts. the film touches on many important concepts that still reverberate today, mainly in race relations and acceptance of sexuality. farrelly and the real life son of tony lip do such a fine job writing a film that knows when to be funny and when to be serious. i think the performances from both leads is also fantastic. we are about done with the year and i dont really care what other people say this should be getting nominations is a few categories at the academy awards. was really surprised at how good this film was, as the trailers dont really show off the true excellence that this film was capable of. urge everyone to go see it, about as good as a buddy road film will be. 810",positive

"the stage curtains open ... im not a nymphomaniac. im a compulsive liar. ive seen this one a few times now, and each time i seem to get something different out of it. the first time i saw it, i was in high school, and the same age as the characters in this movie. i relate most to brian, i think. but, i was more of the book nerd who sat in the back of class who liked to play dd. i guess you could say that i was more of a mix between brian and allison. i fell somewhere between the brain and the basket case. i love this movie. it hits on a personal level, given when it came out, the music and trends of the time ... it can really take me back. the film starts with our teenage high schoolers being dropped off for saturday detention for various offenses, which we find out more about later on. we are introduced to kids from all walks of life. we have the jock, the brain, the princess, the basket case, and the criminal all acted out perfectly by the cast. and, we have the impatient and shortfused teacher who has lost all tolerance for dealing with misfits on a weekend day. practically strangers at first, they find that they all have more in common than they realize, and are able to form a quick bond between them. this is john hughes at his finest. however, despite the honest, believable, and relatable approach to most of the subject matters, the film definitely has its flaws. at movies end, we had the jock and basket case becoming an item, and the princess and criminal pairing up. and poor brian all he got out of it was having to write all their essays for them. the issue of whether they would treat each other the same way when monday came around in the school hallways was dealt with, and in a way that i could agree with. but, when romance bloomed between the two pairs i mentioned above, i was like, no. lol. not happening. even so, this movie is so full of nostalgia for me, that i can easily look past it. the ending was weak, but the journey getting there was so worth it. and that is what this movie is about really. in the real world, they wouldve all gone back to how it was before. my personal favorite character was allison, played by ally sheedy. despite a great overthetop performance by judd nelson, i felt she stole every scene she was in. i highly recommend this movie. such a fun way to spend an evening.",negative
over 20 years later after its bad word of mouth on release i avoided this film untill this year. after watching it i enjoyed it and found it quite creepy and a hell of a lot better then anything released recently. this has a great cast and they are not here for a paycheck and give it their all especially stephen rea. this film did seem to be 2002s punching bag from everyone but give it a watch and see how you feel. this isnt a 0 budget film that looks bad and amatuer acting but a solid horror film of its time that may have been ahead of its time. a great way to spend 90 minutes of your time.,negative

"i wouldnt have watched this if not for a friend who wanted to catch a comedy together, though i must admit im still pretty intrigued and amazed at how writerdirectors jason friedberg and adam seltzer managed to continue get money thrown at them to make terrible, unfunny comedies such as sub par works like meet the spartans, disaster movie, epic movie and date movie, the last which to me was mildly amusing. gone are the days of the zucker brothers, and now were stuck with lowbrow efforts like what friedberg and seltzer continuously dish out, setting their sights at whatevers popular genre at the moment. and that of course is the phenomenon we call twilight, where its already three films old, and taking its cue from the harry potter franchise, decided to split its last book into two films, done squarely for profits. poking fun at something popular is expected, but to do so in the friedbergseltzer fashion just reeks of desperation. they seem to throw anything and everything into the film, without even due consideration if its funny, or not. there are plenty of sight gags, innuendos, and just plain badly designed scenes that dont flow from one to another, making it look like a series of school children skits that got strung together, hammering wooden pegs into rounded holes, and jokes thats 99 bad, youll find more pleasure from experiencing long nails clawed against a chalkboard. even more curious is the demographics out to support watch this film. as i was understandably surrounded by women of all ages who turn out in droves to watch the twilight movies, i was again equally surrounded by the same demographics for this one in a near full house. clearly, i dont think theyre that vacuous to, for a moment, think that their highly anticipated sequel film had arrived, or even remotely suspect that this is a companion film. i suspect though that for all the spoof movies out there, theres always a great chance that the impersonators of their favourite yummy characters will look equally yummy. sorry to burst your bubble, but matt lanter as edward sullen is miles away from robert pattinson as edward cullen even though both cannot act, and chris riggi as jacob white is not taylor lautner as jacob black even though both share equal number of pronounced abs hmm... maybe this could be a reason, team jacob was actually out supporting this?. the only thing that was the rare shining light in this film, happens to be jenn proske as becca crane, who did an awesome job impersonating how kristen stewart would play bella swan, down to all the subtle nuances that if stewart decides to leave her role, then the twilight producers can plonk proske right in. its really uncanny watching her ham up the bella spoof, but do note that im not praising her performance either as shes just carboncopying what another actress had done, although pitch perfect. i did laugh out loud here and there, but its laughing at the film in how it got away with the stupidest of jokes and the absurdity at who this project could have been green lit by a hollywood studio says a lot, doesnt it? i hope friedberg and seltzer either learn from the best in the comedic business, or quit filmmaking altogether. vampires suck sucks. period. and im just feeling dirty having to recount what i had watched, and to craft a review for it.",negative

"this film is so banal it takes the banality out of the banal. the premise is absurd. the unravelling of the plot is absurd. the performances are, at best, distracted as is the direction. even the actors seem unconvinced. im still kicking myself for watching this film. sin and purity are depicted with juvenile simplicity. religious bias is arrogantly displayed but ill leave that to the unfortunate viewer to spot. complex ideas like forgiveness, atonement and judgement are reduced to idiocy at an atomic level. i apologise if this sounds too much like a rant but for someone who watches well over 15 films a week, i have never subjected myself to anything this offensive to the senses in over 25 years.",negative
"i cant stress it enough that watching a piece that is so simple will be the one that touches your soul very closely. if you are doubting whether you should watch this show or not because one of your friend suggested you to, trust them completely. i will tell you how your days will go after watching this show. first, you have to trust all the good reviews in the world and start watching. second, you will enjoy this show starting from the first episode. third, nobody will tell you to continue watching further, but you will anyway. then after finishing this show, you thank your friend. or should i say you will thank yourself because you chose to finish this show? doesnt really matter. i find at least 3 reasons why people are doubting this show. first. isnt this show just like any other friendships movieseries?. short answer, its not. dont get me wrong, any kind of good friendships film will definitely warm your heart, i always love friendships films. however, there are too many other treasures to talk about that you can find in this show. role of moms, dads, admirers, crushes, dreams, siblings, fate, boys gang, girls gang, exes, education, morals, marriages. and why are they even important? because you will then really understand to be in other peoples shoes. second. there are not much going on in 1988, is this even relevant? isnt this extremely boring?. well, definitely you wont find any fancy things here. no fancy fiction things just like any other korean dramas, no major plot twist or whatsoever. my question is, why is that even a problem? really you dont have to worry all of those questions. the show will still feel very close to us that you really want to be one of the characters. unfortunately, rewatching the show again and again will be the only way you can make your dream come true. third. i can guess the plot. there is one girl in those friendships, so it will just be triangle or rectangle love story, just like any others. again. please do yourself a favor not to worry these things. there are sooo many things that you can talk about rather than worrying if there is good romance aspects or not. last thing i want to remind you because you have arrived to this review. please. thank. your. friend.",positive
the trouble with sequels is that they cant leave well alone.this movie is no more than a send up with no fright power whatsoever.it might as well have had a totally different title then it could be said to have been inspired by it comes across as like a dream where nothing makes sensesome guy is knocked down at the beginning and then says im all right before he drops dead.it then increases in silliness. its as if the makers wanted to make the most illogical horror movie but its really an insult to even the intelligence of an idiot. and what the hell was the point of the fast food restaurant!?! the book about the texas chainsaw massacre is where they should have gonethis is supposedly the real account based on investigative journalism which traces the leatherface character to a shack where hes become obese and speechless. but that would have taken too much intelligence to reconstruct as a movie so this was the easy way out,negative
"i knew this movie is going to be that bad. i dont think its necessary to make movies like this. comparing the emoji movie with foodfight, you can tell that both of the stories had made no sense whatsoever. dont get me wrong, i enjoy other animated movies made by sony like open season and monster house, but my question to sony is...why???",negative
"while bollywood is still struggling to justify star culture, here is a refreshing and intelligently made movies which stand as a proof that if we invest on story writers, actors rather than stars, and directors with creative freedom, we will get a delight of a movie. this one touches on many subjects, but handles each one delicately rather than forcing an opinion. both the leading ladies nitanshi and prathibha executed their part perfectly, and while there was less for sparsh to do, he ensured he gets a spot on perfection every time he is on screen. ravi kishan was the delightful surprise or he was always this good and we were not giving him his due. i do want to shout out for the writers mr biplab! we would like to see more of your work. screenplay and dialogues were captivating and kept the audience engaged.",negative
"really, it could have. my personal opinion of lohan aside, this movie like others dead silence for one relied heavily on effects that at times, become quite distracting. some of the shots in the film are beautiful, but the use of blue is really overdone, some of the special effects are lacking, and some of the weapons are just ridiculous the big blue glass knife? are you kidding me?. whether you see symbolism in the use of colour depends on the viewers mindset but even so, the use of blue is just overwhelming at times. this is probably the point but it starts to distract from the plot. the acting is alright. for the most part, lohan does a good job. the parents arent very convincing, and at times the dialog becomes stale, and somewhat corny. however, the movie is easy enough to follow that people who dont like complex horror films can sit back, and enjoy the ride. if you do prefer a bit more mystery, youll have this figured out about halfway through, and the end will seem to drag. the big plot twist at the end was original enough, however for me it seemed like a cop out. it works fine, its just not quite as exciting as it could have been. kind of left me thinking oh... thats all? theres a small bit of nudity, a sex scene, and lots of dirty dancing. so if your decision rests on one of those things, now you know. surprisingly, there are several gory scenes as well. i wouldnt recommend bringing small children to see this, though i doubt that will stop some people from bringing their kids along. it isnt scary, but the gore in some parts might be a bit much for younger audiences, or people who really cant deal with it. its nothing like saw or hostel in the area of gore, but there were a couple scenes that made me flinch. in the end, the film really didnt bring anything new to the table. the storyline is simple, and easy to follow, some of the shots are nice, and the acting on a whole is mediocre at worst. so if you have nothing better to do, its an alright film to waste an hour or so with. but dont go expecting an award winner youll be left disappointed.",negative
"im not going to say a lot, but i saw this in the movie theatre and didnt really thiink that it was that bad. than i watched the dvd version and found out that they cut a lot of scenes, that would have helped the flow and logic of the movie a whole lot. why o why did they cut these. im sure the ratings would have been just a little higher with the movie intact.",negative

"this movie is one of a kind and even that is too big of a compliment for this seriously lackluster movie. it tries to be funny and thoughtful and ends up being incredibly and offensively stupid, racist, and trite. the comedy consistently misses the mark by a huge margin. this movie was intended to be a comedy although its shockingly unfunny despite an almost foolproof set of comic circumstances and actors. was it supposed to be a black caddyshack or was it supposed to be a story of achievement? the movies underlying message ends up being a thinlyveiled message of unfocused racist hate directed at white people which is actually not funny at all. watching this film was an hour and a half of my life wasted. if you are considering watching or renting this movie please do yourself a favor and dont. absolutely no redeeming value, even in its terribleness. consider yourself warned.",negative

"scarred by the loss of his wife and eggs, marlin has over sheltered his only child, nemo. however when nemos first day at school comes about, that mothering leads nemo to swim out to the open ocean where he is caught by a scuba diver and be put in a fish tank far away. enlisting help from the forgetful dory, marlin tracks the boat and his ocean adventure begins. now as much as a tradition as national holidays, the latest pixar animation arrives in the uk on a wave doh! of hype and marketing. officially the biggest summer film in the us and all over buses and happy meals which seems a little perverse when you think about it it is hard not to want to see it or prevent your kids from demanding they see it. happily the well establish benchmark of being kiddie friendly but fun for adults is maintained and the film does exactly what you know it will. the plot is a little like toy storys quest but is fleshed out enough to be interesting and the themes of letting go and loss are actually quite well handled and will speak more to adults than kids. the slight problem with the film is that is does do just what you expect and the animated film with adult wit and kiddie characters stuff is hardly cutting edge anymore. however this is a picky flaw as it is still very good fun. it may not be the strongest of this genre, indeed some bits flag and the sentimental core, while a break from cruel humour or sarcasm, does then to slow things down a bit at times. the adult references are all good but not as frequent as id have liked they seem to be separate from the main flow where i wanted them integral with all of it. clever homages to jaws bruce was the pet name of the rubber shark and the birds are distracting and make you feel good about yourself, and the banter is mostly witty if lacking a real sharpness at times. the voice cast are all good are quite an all star bunch. brooks does a workmanlike job in the lead it must be said i didnt think he distinguished himself but then he did have to carry the moral weight of the film. degeneres is much better and her dippy character is a delight at times. the support cast is not as deep and fun as in other films janney and dafoe are both fun in the tank as are all the tank characters its just that none of them are really consistent. my favourite characters were the one word seagulls mine? overall i have been unfair to this film in my review. if i saw this in isolation i would be praising it to the roof, however using the others as a benchmark this does have a few weaknesses that show signs of wear and tear in the genre. not to cancel everything i have said, these weaknesses are all things that i realised after i had watched it while i was watching it i was too busy laughing! biggest downside for me though no comedy outtakes, booooooo!",positive
"brilliant sitcom, no questions asked. it is a show which is not only entertaining but also teaches one, on how to go through the many aspects of life. it really is one of the most wholesome shows in the game, the acting, the plot, the setting, just wonderful and ever so fitting. seeing sheldon and his family go through different life stages at different ages, really gives a general idea of life. overall, i think its a must watch show, if youre looking for something packed with entertainment and life lessons to pick along the journey! young sheldon is often hailed as one of the best tv shows of all time for its heartwarming blend of humor, nostalgia, and relatable family dynamics. it masterfully dives into the backstory of sheldon cooper,",positive

"shows such as futurama, the simpsons and archer were presumed to have set the bar for animated series in the modern era. with all due respect, rick and morty walked in with elements from all these great shows and simply decimated the competition. the writers have undoubtedly created a masterpiece. a true jewel among the current roster for similar shows. every episode is a rollercoaster and leaves you with laughs and thought provoking concepts. the way in which they have intertwined the futuristic elements and family drama in such a coherent and enticing manner is no joke. ive watched episodes over and over again to see if they have any discernible flaws. and im glad to say ive found none. the way theyve set the show up allows limitless possibilities and that is great news for the impatient fans like me who cannot wait to see what they conjure up for the next season. truly enjoyable and i recommend everyone give this show a try.",positive
"i tried to see this movie last night with my wife in a multiplex called pvr cinemas. i divested rs. 540 as ticket charges on the movie. one by one i was getting signals from nature not to see the movie. like first i did not get enough time to get my favorite sub at subway, but i thought ill buy nachos inside pvr. even inside i didnt get nachos, on top of that i also did not get the sandwich inside pvr. i ignored all these bad signs and went ahead to see this awful, creepy, mindless movie. akshay kumar once knew acting, he may know it now also but the great director farah khan is utilizing all her resources to bring the man akshay down by using cheapest of cheapest pjs in the movie. i wonder who write these, moreover who approves these... once upon a time she also made a movie known as main hoon na which i liked to some extent as it is a light hearted movie, but tmk is not something i expected. i still like akshay as a heroactor, he has done so many good movies.i beg him not to do movie like these, plz plz plz. believe me friends you can laugh at least 100000000000 times more by just watching 1 performance of any character in comedy circus. i dont know how many zeors i added here because of frustration please avoid this movie to save yourself from heart attack. last night i have vowed not to see any forthcoming farah khans movie unless and until i get at least 100 out of 100 good reviews. i think this is a scam by which hindi film industry is trying to make films which ppl will leave before ending like i got 15 minutes after the interval and they still have to pay money for the full movie.",negative

"what if tommy wiseau decided to direct and star in a body horror film? the answer would definitely look like the final installment of the human centipede series. from highlyimprobable scenarios to disappointing technical issues, human centipede iii is a lesson on the things a movie should not do. im certain that hc fans were expecting the most bizarre and graphical depiction of the creation of the ultimate mouthtoanus chimera, but practically only a glimpse of the beast was shown during the anticlimax. same with the human caterpillar. probably as a black comedy this movie could work dieter laser characters yelling lines were absolutely hilarious, as well as the scenes where he pushes his secretary out of the office. also, when have you seen a governor that looks as unkempt as the one in the movie? even the appearance of tom six himself was risible remember the music that played every time he drives his mercedes into the prison?. conclusion if you have watched the previous hc films and you are bored to hell, watch this. if not, well, dont bother and watch the first one.",positive

"for every really great film that we see in cinemas, there are 100 really bad ones made at the same time. for every really great film made, there are 100 really bad films that are basically about the same thing. for example, scrooged starring bill murray is about an evil business man who goes through a change of heart at christmas time and becomes a loving caring man who loves christmas. santa with muscles stars hulk hogan as an evil businessman who gets amnesia and thinks he is santa claus, becoming caring and loves christmas. movies with similar stories, but whereas scrooged is a brilliant film, santa with muscles is not. hobgoblins seems to be, to me, a really bad gremlins clone featuring lots of annoying kids and evil ugly furry little creatures, like the gremlins. however whereas gremlins was a brilliant and funny movie, hobgoblins is not. it does have its moments, like the first time we see the hobgoblins, one of the funniest moments i have seen in film truly dire example of film, but funny because of it. the acting is very low quality, and the characters are intensely annoying and badly written. the film has a nice concept of the hobgoblins being evil little creatures who use a form of telepathy to control people and allowing them to act out their deepest most carnal desires, or in some instances, forcing them to act out on carnal desires that normally would make them physically sick. the only way to stop the creatures is to kill them all before dawn. it has the potential to make a good film and it is an interesting idea but unfortunately it is just very badly executed, with little thought being given to the characters, the script, the direction, sets, makeup, locations, editing, sound, props, and really everything you could think of. the continuity in the film is really bad, in fact it makes spiderman look continuous. especially the very end. watch it and prepare to see something that is laughingly bad and just utterly unbelievable at the end. the only reason to watch this film is because, like with most truly awful films, it is so bad its funny. it is just about possible to survive this film under normal circumstances, but i recommend watching this one with mst3k insulation as mike, tom and crow make it a lot more bearable. mst3k insulation is something that is familiar to people who have read my other reviews of bad films. basically mst3k insulation means that mike or joel and tom servo make the film bearable with their quips and riffs. they insulate you from the spiritsucking soulcrushing badness of the film. mst3k insulation never watch a bad film without it. gets one star for being so bad that it makes you laugh till you hurt. just about crests 2 stars for a half interesting plot. the total lack of anything else stops it being 3 stars.",negative

"the storyline and dialogue in this show is suitable for grade 4 level children. it is so ridiculous that half an episode was all i could take. it is insulting to all womens intelligence. no woman would dress like that. i like carrie preston, but she has been directed to act like an idiot. these days shows like that, and there are many of them, are designed to lower our intelligence and distract us from reality. the fact that so many people tolerate them just shows that we no longer expect rational conversations or insights into issues that are relevant. and this isnt even amusing. discouraged.",negative

"i watched the movie and thought it was just a normal romantic comedy and just about of the quality of two weeks notice. i didnt find anything awful about it. it was entertaining. maybe a bit too long for the story, but it kept me interested. i didnt find it boring, nor did i think the dialogs were worse than in many other movies that were released this year, e.g. lets say legally blonde 2. if people expect a highqualityscript they should go rent schindlers list, but to slam a movie thats meant to entertain, is just uncalled for. i realize that many do not like jennifer and ben being a couple and being promoted a lot by the media. but it should be about the movie itself, and not about what the main characters are doing in real life with one another. i really do not understand the whole propaganda against the movie. id advise everyone to just have a look for themselves staying openminded still after having read a lot of awful reviews of people that just go with what the majority says and that only dislike the main actors.",negative
"i wanted to post a quick review of this movie because i really dont think it deserves all the negative reviews its getting here. breach, to me, very much felt like a lowbudget science fiction horror movie along the lines of the ones they used to make in the 80s and 90s. its dark and gritty and, what i found to be refreshing this day and age, not politically correct at all. one reviewer complained the sets look bad, but i thought they appeared exactly like i expect and want the inside of a space ship to look like in a bleak, futuristic world where earth has gone to hell and mankind is struggling to survive. both it and its crew reminded me of event horizon since the atmosphere and look of breach are very similar to that and also reminiscent of alien 3. maybe those two wont go down in history as the best science fiction movies ever made, but i, for one, still enjoyed them and i would much rather watch something like breach than all of those clean and realistic ones that are being produced nowadays, like the martian or gravity. back in the 80s and 90s they made many dark, low budget sci fi movies, which were not very realistic at all, but that wasnt the point. they all took place in a bleak, hopeless future where humanity had destroyed all the beauty in the world and life was basically a daily struggle for survival in whatever setting the movie took place. but after the matrix came out, science fiction changed although, ironically, those films take place in a similar setting and the only movies i can think of which were made in that style in the 2000s are doomsday and the gene generation, although they used a bit too much cgi for my taste. 2018s death race 4 beyond anarchy was better in that way and it was very refreshing to me to having been able to watch another film that tries to keep that particular niche alive. as for bruce willis, i thought he was very good in breach and delivered pretty much what youd expect from him in this role the witty, tough as nails antihero that hes become famous for. so give this movie a chance. of course its not as good as alien or even event horizon, but watching it, it brought back memories from when i was a teenager, checking out the science fiction and horror sections of my local video store, looking for exactly this kind of film. im happy it got made if only for allowing me to experience that sensation again years later when there arent even any more of those magical places left in the world.",negative

"i love gravity falls i really do, it had amazing animation, the comedy is great, the story is interesting when it decides to exist, the main characters are all pretty enjoyable, and all the different scenarios the characters find themselves in are always engaging. really enjoyable overall. but its not perfect. the internet will have you beleive gravity falls is a masterclass of design with amazing mystery and storytelling and pacing with amazing characters and theyll say all this is true because alex hirsch wrote the story before actually making the show. and i agree this is commendable because writing a story as you go doesnt always work out. but the gravity falls story is lackluster. its mysteries are interesting but the series doesnt handle them properly. to have a good mystery you need to set something up to build intrigue, hint at the mystery subtly as the show goes on, and then pay it off. but gravity falls will set something up, build intrigue, and then forget the mystery exists for like 10 episodes and sometimes a whole season just to suddenly pay it off at some point and youre just like oh great i totally forgot that was even a thing but cool not to mention the horrible pacing. the story does exist but it only wants to exist 25 of the time. this is a short show, only 2 seasons, 40 episodes, to complete the entire story. and somehow they manage to put so much filler in this show. the first season has almost no plot to speak of, and when they actually get into the interesting stuff with season 2 they still cram filler episodes between important plot threads where it doesnt fit at all, just so dipper and his grunkle can play dungeons and dragons for a little bit. next id like to talk about the side characters. theyre all somewhat enjoyable but theyre not characters theyre one note jokes that just hop around town doing nothing the whole show. now this would be fine except for the fact that the impact of the finale hinges completely on you caring about these characters, and aside from the main 5 and maybe 1 or 2 others, i dont care about this town and its people. since season 1 had barely any plot what they should have done is used some of those filler episodes to focus on all the side characters of the town, give each of the townsfolk one episode that just shows you who they are and makes you care about them. that way they feel like actual people, then the filler would be less offensive. instead season 1 just has a bunch of episodes where the main cast goes around and does random stuff that doesnt effect anything, and for an episodic show that would be fine but for this short show built on its engaging plot its a problem. now theres 3 side characters i want to talk about specifically because theyre absolutely horrible. first 2 are candy and grenda, mables friends that appear very often in the show. theyre insufferable, they never made me laugh once, and even though theyre in so many episodes they get no development whatsoever. theres 2 episodes i can name where they try and develop these 2 characters but by the end of each whatever they were trying to do ultimately means nothing and they go back to being the same old characters again. last is gideon. the secondary antagonist to the show and the main antagonist for season 1. hes egregious. not as bad as candy and grenda but hes still really bad. his whole character is hes a little kid that everyone loves cuz hes cute, but he actually had a vendetta against stan, so he does antagonistic things to steal his shack. issue is i can never take him as a threat because the show never treats him as such. and even when he gets close to achieving his goal at a certain point im just left wondering why exactly im suddenly supposed to take this joke of a character seriously. and then after a certain point he basically dissappears from the show entirely leaving no impact, so he was essentially a plot device just so our main characters can get ahold of something important. the last thing id like to talk about is the main villain bill cipher. hes a really enjoyable villain, hes only in 6 episodes of the show but i have no problem with that. sometimes less is more, just like star vs the forces of evil. the main villain of that show is toffee and hes amazing, yet out of the 77 episodes of the show he only makes a physical appearance in 7. bill is shown all over this show, his little hieroglyph is shown at the end of the theme song in every episode, and his mystery is the only mystery in this show that was handled well. the writers did something amazing with him by making him a very funny joke villain that is still a major threat. i tend to hate joke villains in shows because theyre never actually threatening but bill on the other hand is hilarious but scary at the same time. its brilliant. hes a very good villain but not one of the best cartoon villains of all time like some people will say. going back to star vs the forces of evil for a second, i beleive toffee is a much better villain than bill. toffee had history, motives, and a major effect on the main characters through the entire show even well after his death. but bill doesnt influence our main characters much at all until the finale. he shows up to mess with dipper and mabel a few times before the ending but its always a one episode situation, the twins deal with him and he dissapears for a while, hardly ever even getting mentioned. and his motivesbackstory is very unclear. he says he was from a 2d planet but wanted to break through to the third dimension or something, but he doesnt have much of a reason to do what he does. and dont get me wrong i love a good evil for the sake of evil all powerful god antagonist they can be really fun, but those types of villains are never revolutionary or leave a lasting impact because their characters are very shallow. bill is just a generic evil deity that makes deals and wants nothing more than complete destruction of our world. so i dont understand why so many people think hes some revolutionary villain. just because he has a fun personality doesnt mean hes an interesting villain in concept or execution. hes funny sure, enjoyable to watch sure, but he has nothing to him. so overall i really do like gravity falls. if i didnt i wouldnt have given it 8 stars. its a fun watch and id definitely reccomend it, but it has big issues with its narrative and i dont think for a second it deserves all the overwhelming praise it gets. its a very good show, but its not revolutionary. just because the story was planned out from the beginning doesnt make instantly amazing. sometimes writing as you go can even have its benefits, so you can feel how the show works a little bit before fully committing to a single plot line. maybe you see how your show is turning out and realize the story might work a little better if it goes in a slightly different direction than what you originally envisioned. crafting a narrative is an art form and it doesnt always have to be crafted the same exact way. let writers do what they want, if it works out great, if it doesnt thats a good learning experience for them. go watch gravity falls if you want a fun comedy with a pretty interesting plot. but if youre big into storytelling like i am, i wouldnt expect something revolutionary in the narrative department, because thats not what gravity falls offers. it offers a compact story about a family trying to stop an all powerful being, thats way more focused on episodic adventures than the actual main storyline. its a fun time.",positive

"yes, kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies, but with humanity. here we have shaq as a rapping genie yes, a rapping genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits, all ending in him in a christlike pose with lots of light surrounding him. so, yeah, expect really cheesy bits, including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and, regrettably, not knocking out the two main characters, particularly the kid. what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille oneill would be so incredibly schmaltzy! the main plot of the film involves this kid, played in that alltootypical and annoyingkid fashion by the greatgrandson of frank capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily, who comes upon a genie whos been trapped in a boombox. then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the shaqgenie his quasislave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shadygangtype absentee father. this really sappy, contrived son and father story would be bad enough, as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies i.e. the two chances in life speech from father to son. but its shaquille oneill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically, and the obvious sinking crux of it all. his plot line involves him, when not getting the overtalky treatment from capra, to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career. on top of this, he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boombox. so is there a camp factor to the movie? up to a point, but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and heartfelt moments that have really no business with the rest of the material. one might ask if the people making the movie, who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon, if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing. id hope that they too knew they were just getting paid. but id hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaqmachine. so, if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genieturnedrapperturnedwisecracker, all the more fun to you. hell, it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel. but if youre hoping to keep a few brain cells, stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996, and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90s.",negative
"how did this masterpiece go overlooked? such a great movie. its one of those movie for movie buffs really, but im sure even the broader mainstream audience will pick on its genius. thats what this is sheer genius. it might be unintentionally so, but how many times do you see a bear suit in the final act of a film being pulled out with such nonchalant bravery? the beginning might leave you a little confused, but the moment you catch that horrible acting delivered by the police buddy you get a hint of whats to come a lot of laughoutloud moments. many lines of dialog are sure to become cult classic, such as phallic symbols, phallic symbols, the bees are in my eyes, howd it get burned? x 4, step away from the bike and many others. it could use a little trimming in the editing, but the slow moments are crucial to enhance the precision with which it walks on the fine line that separates farce from tragedy. highly recommended to any film fan or to anybody looking for some many laughs.",negative

"ragtime music fills up for the silences present in most scenes of the sting, in a choice i both like and am confused by. if the idea was to romantically portray the 30s, i think the plot events have a little rummage with that thesis of presentation. its brisk, in the way that leaves you at once cold from it and charmed by it, and it was a darling at the oscars, winning seven out of ten noms, including that all important big one you can see why, the sting has a graceful tone behind it harkening to audience expectancy, and by having the grittiness of the new hollywood wave that was still causing crashes in 73, it plays to all sides and sensibilities of the viewing spectrum.",positive

"watched saving christmas out of curiosity to see if it really was as bad as the universal panning, its ranking on the bottom 100 and its razzie wins and nominations in most categories made out. the film is not available in my country, but the full film can be found online for anyone to see just in case anybody is wondering how it came to be watched by me. finally seeing saving christmas, it turned out it not only really is that terrible but is one of my most regretted film viewings. one where a very early bailing was strongly considered but generously stuck with it in order to be fair, never judge films without seeing the whole thing wish that more people did that instead of bragging about walking out after twenty minutes or something similarly ridiculous. it is by far the worst film of 2014, an easy contender for the worst of the decade and is bottom 5 material. and kirk camerons immature and condescending defence of saving christmas and attacking those who hated it note to mr cameron, you dont have to be an atheist or even religious to find saving christmas a terrible film, speaking as someone who is neither but with not a biased against christians bone in my body is a perfect example of what is wrong with how people express their opinions on film, critics and film watchers today. people who have an inability to tell the difference between fact and opinion, resort to the im right and youre wrong clich and have to insult others, bash critics and invent ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories. back to talking about saving christmas, the whole thing is hopelessly inept. it feels very slapped together with no rhyme or coherence, with amateurishly designed, written and acted biblical flashbacks, a lot of padding with scenes that go on forever got tired of the scenes in the car fast, which saw lots of forced at best acting and gobbledegook that passes for dialogue, lots of repetition like with the hot chocolate and the car conversations and others having no reason for being there and camerons dubious generalisations refuse to call them facts and narration that come over as preachy, biased, selfabsorbed sermonising standing out as especially bad. oh and that ending dance sequence was an abomination in every sense, pacing, choreography, music, everything. it even looks bad, with some of the most artificial production values one will find anywhere let alone a film, complete with pedestrian photography and disjointed editing. the music was instantly forgettable as soon as the film was finally over and as for the direction, what direction? there is no coherence to the whole thing, the pacing is all over the place interminably dull mostly and there has never been more nonexistent direction of actors, even on films riffed on mst3k. writing is appalling from heavyhanded, egotistical start to abominable finish. that for cameron has already been discussed but there is nothing heartwarming, funny or insightful about saving christmas, nothing that makes one think hard or feel anything. for a festive occasion, one couldnt imagine and will never see again a more drearily portrayed christmas, this actually felt like it was made by people who hated christmas even more than ebeneezer scrooge did. one is just bored out of their mind and angry at their life being wasted on a film that has no engagement, is so poorly put together and made, is impossible to learn anything from or get emotionally invested in and talks at them. am not easily preached at, but saving christmas talked at and down to me. camerons acting is extremely forced and patronising, pretty much like mugging, throughout and his huge ego bursts alive just as much on screen, in his material and how he delivered it, as it did when he attacked those who panned the film for far more legitimate reasons than he and the very small minority agreeing with him can ever give for finding any kind of value in the film. to me he is hypocritical as well as egotistical, due to that it is christians that are more likely than anybody else to feel patronised to the most. the other cast members are not worth mentioning, dont even remember many, thats how much cameron and his ego dominates. overall, one of, and one of the biggest examples of, not many irredeemably awful films out there. unless watching for curiositys sake, this is a must avoid. 010 an unheard of rating for me these days, have grown to hate giving them out, but saving christmas is in the top 10 of the most deserving recipients of it. bethany cox",positive

"what started out as a great show through 3 seasons turned into a draining repetativeness of the same lines with no real thought for new ideas to better grab the viewer. the characters are strong in themselves, all self sabotaging their own relationships and work dealings in every episode. after season 4 it became painful to watch, forcing myself to finish it just to get through the shows. sarah rafferty as donna does an amazing job with her character throughout the show. rick hoffman as louis is the one you start out hating then becomes a great comedic relief even with his characters constant misinterpretation and meddling with everything around him. gabriel macht does a good job with his overconfidence in the character, tho the constant right now, listen to me, and youre going to do this or else becomes painful after season 4, lines that most of the cast uses. the entire show is about every firm and attorney in the city plotting against and stabbing each other in the back, even in their own firms and with their own staff. its soap opera production with an argument based writing structure.",positive
"in the book the films of arthur freed, freed made one comment about singin in the rain that always stood out in my mind. as the film was about the hollywood era when films were learning to talk, freed said that there was no need to do any research as he lived the research. he and any number of people who were still working at mgm a quarter of a century later. the knowledge that folks had who worked on singin in the rain and the talent of gene kelly are the two things that make that film some consider the greatest of all musicals. arthur freed who wrote a lot of the song lyrics in those twenties and thirties mgm musicals together with his partner, composer nacio herb brown, just reached into his own catalog for the score. the whole score is brownfreed except for moses which was written by roger edens and adolph green and betty comden and fit as a fiddler with lyrics by freed and music by al goodheart and al hoffman. the only original song written for the show was make em laugh by brown and freed and was donald oconnors specialty. you have to put that in quotes because even the writers agreed they ripped off cole porters be a clown. which is from an mgm musical that arthur freed produced. lucky they werent sued. of course the number that singin in the rain is noted for is the title tune sung and danced in the splashing rain by gene kelly. that and the broadway melody ballet became two of his signature numbers. i know i dont enjoy myself as much as mr. kelly did in that inclement weather. jean hagen got a best supporting actress nomination for playing that shimmering star in the cinema firmament lina lamont. unfortunately she lost to gloria grahame for the bad and the beautiful. one thing that the silent screen did was mask a whole lot of personalities whose voices did not fit the screen image created. that was done for great comic affect by hagen, but kelly in some of his love scenes was using the tragedy of john gilbert who acted in two much the classical manner as a continental lover. just think how history might have been different if gilbert had the background of a song and dance man and could have transitioned to musicals. of course debbie reynolds is just fine in her first real starring part as the young singing hopeful whose career is made by sound. so many in fact were, as many as those that were broken. a favorite of mine in this is douglas fowley the harassed director trying to get a talking performance out of the nasal hagen and dealing with the new technology at the same time. as freed said, no research was needed. singin in the rain is a product of his life experience in those early days of sound.",positive

"the big bang theory is a standout in the world of sitcoms, blending sharp humor, geek culture, and heartwarming character dynamics into a longrunning and highly entertaining show. premiering in 2007 and spanning 12 seasons, the series gained immense popularity due to its unique approach to comedy, lovable yet quirky characters, and clever writing. one of the series biggest strengths is its cast, led by jim parsons, whose portrayal of sheldon cooper became one of the most iconic comedic performances in television history. his eccentric, highly logical, and socially inept character provides endless laughs while also delivering surprisingly heartfelt moments. johnny galecki as leonard brings warmth and relatability, while kaley cuoco as penny adds a refreshing contrast to the scientific world of her friends. the supporting cast, including simon helberg howard and kunal nayyar raj, also shine, each contributing their own brand of humor and depth to the series. another aspect that makes the big bang theory so enjoyable is its ability to evolve. while the early seasons rely heavily on geeky humor and references to comic books, star wars, and physics, later seasons introduce more emotional depth, romantic storylines, and character development. the addition of new characters, such as amy farrah fowler mayim bialik and bernadette rostenkowski melissa rauch, further enriches the show, providing fresh dynamics and expanding the relationships within the group. overall, the big bang theory is a sitcom that successfully combines humor, intelligence, and heart. its witty dialogue, memorable characters, and unique premise set it apart from other comedies, making it a beloved favorite for many. whether youre a science enthusiast or just looking for a fun, lighthearted series, this show delivers a consistently enjoyable experience that keeps audiences coming back for more.",positive

"laapataladies womensupportingwomen iwd2024 mustwatch interestingly, the reviews of the film by leading dailies prove the very point that the film attempts to make... about the invisibility of women, and their lack of agency . here it is .. the toi says its a story of two husbands who lose their wives, filmibeat also called it a story of two young husbands, business standard calls it the story of a husband who loses his wife , abp live comments on the laughter it evokes, the indian express says it is struggling to stay afloat so not true . only a handful got it right ! filmfare, the hindu, and a few others. and this is the very premise of the film. based on an award winning story written by biplab goswami, kiran rao returns to direction after 14 years with this delightfully thought provoking social commentary on womens empowerment . and wow, does she deliver ! the story is set in a fictitious village in a state called nirmal pradesh, reflective of any state in the cow belt of india. it revolves around phool, and jaya two women who are on their way to their new marital homes, and due to identical veils, phools husband mistakenly brings jaya home, instead of phool. phool realised late at the last stop that she has been deserted, and jaya knowingly accompanies the wrong husband to his home. when both husbands realise that ones wife is wrong and the others wife is missing, starts the journey of finding them and returning them to their rightful homes . phool is a shy, simple village girl, with no exposure to the world at large, and does not know either the address of her village or the address of her husbands home. . jaya is a girl who is a brilliant student and top ranked amongst 200 students , but has been forced to marry a man who has reportedly killed off his first wife due to dowry. both women experience freedom, a sense of agency , and in the process they find themselves . in 5 days, they undergo a life altering journey of self discovery, and confidence. the veil of the two brides is metaphoric in nature ... and the lifting the veils of social ills like patriarchy, education, lack of power, no freedom of choice, apart from the more obvious ills of lack of education, dowry. very very masterfully, the story starts being told through the eyes of the men the husbands , the policeman and soon shifts gears towards the actual story of the women . if they had not got lost, they would probably never have found their voice, their confidence and their will. three vital skills needed to live a life of control and happiness . a special mention needs to be made of the character manju maai who runs a tea stall at the station where phool gets lost. she unexpectedly plays the reluctant catalyst in the transformation of phool .. and their scenes and dialogues leave you hanging on your each word. masked, layered and simple all the same time ! she aids phool to look within and question everything, of why just being obedient and skilled at housework is not good upbringing . she is also the person who introduces phool to the thrill of earning an income, however meagre is might have been. womens empowerment is such a loosely used term, seldom portrayed in its real sense at the grassroots level. what does empowerment mean to a woman ? only a woman can tell ! its different for each woman, as its different for jaya and phool. but the sisterhood between the two when they come face to face in the end makes you want to stand up and dance and weep with joy! nitanshi goel as phool, pratibha ranta as jaya , sparsh srivastava as deepak, chaya kadam as manju maai, ravi kishan as the police inspector have given spectacular performances. but the real hero is the story itself and the nuanced and skilful direction by kiran rao. take a bow !! this gem is not to be missed . films like this come once in a blue moon . savour every minute every dialogue . its definitely the breakout film of this year !",positive

"the simpsons, this is a show that has overcome so many odds, and still has been one of the best shows to even hit a television. the simpsons was the funniest, most original show you could find on tv. i used to watch the show at least 5 times a day, i always needed my daily simpsons buzz. the best of seasons were from 4 to 8, that is when they were at their funniest and most creative. but as the seasons went on, the show started to lose its edge. now going to season 17, i dont think i can bear to watch the show anymore. it hurts me so much to see a show that i have been watching my whole life, crumble down like michael jacksons empire. the last season was absolutely horrendous, it was the worst season yet! i do admit, though, there were a few good episodes, like when homer smuggled drugs from canada... but this season, the bad episodes overcame the good episodes. they have been starting to run out of ideas since season 12, but it definitely showed on this season. they need to get some of their best writers back, people like conan obrien, or bill oakley, they were some of the best writers that the show has ever seen. now that most of their people have gone, the show has crumbled in to nothing. it is so sad to see such a classic fall like this, but there is still hope... today, i just bought season 6 on dvd, and i can now enjoy what was once some of the funniest episodes ever, anytime i want. i will still always love the classic episodes, and i will still watch the new episodes because i am a hardcore simpsons fan, but the show should end now, its getting to the point where it is unbearable to watch. please groening, just let it go, you are meddling with a classic. overall, i would give the show 10 stars, the show may have a lot of bad episodes, but there are too many good ones to ruin this show for me. please end it...",positive

"the good thing about watching movies years after they come out is that you can form a nuanced opinion without the influence of the cultural reception at the time. watching kazaam taught me that theres nothing nuanced about how terrible this movie is. you heard it was bad. i heard it was bad. we can now agree that theres nothing clouding our judgment. this movie reeks of the decade it was made in. physicallyincapableofacting basketball star shaq is the title character, a genie that lives in a boombox. the protagonist of the movie is max, a bratty kid that finds kazaam in an abandoned building. were supposed to sympathize with max because hes bullied, but hes such a little jerk that its actually cathartic to watch him get bullied. kazaam and max make an unlikely pair, not just because a 7 foot tall black man follows a little white boy around new york like a lost puppy, but also because kazaam wants to go through the three wishes to gain his freedom and hopefully get far, far away from this kid, and max, in a completely realistic and tightly written portrayal of the selfish child that he is, decides that he doesnt want to use any of the magic wishes his genie is begging him to make. the plot of the film revolves around max learning that his mother lied to him all these years and that his father actually lives in the city, so he goes off to see his father for the first time in however many years kazaam is along for the ride. hes crushed to find out that his dad is a total sleazebag like father like son music executive and eventually its up to kazaam to use his miraculous powers not to end poverty, war or world hunger but to mend this broken white family. theres another sleazebag that figures out kazaam is a genie and plots to steal him out from under max. if you found shaqs nonacting to be distressing, prepare yourself for the trauma that is his rapping. this movie fails in just about every conceivable way. a story about a kid and his genie should be pretty straightforward but somehow, most of the characters are unlikable, the plot is dull and predictable, and ill sound like a broken record if i keep talking about the acting. space jam, this is not.",negative

"it has long been thought that the musical era was born out of pure enthusiasm over the ability to put sound on film. and while the case holds water, it is not entirely correct. as singin in the rain, so eloquently shows comedy, charm, music, and dance can all be featured successfully within one film. singin in the rain, is also generally known as the greatest musical of all time. roger ebert, the late gene siskel, leonard maltin, and many other prominent critics agree with that opinion. the plot was born from a song and used others that had been around for many years, ever since the talkies were born in the late 20s. the screenplay was written according to the songs. although the cast had been cast, and recast several times the end result was one of perfect chemistry. the combination of the everso talented gene kelly arguably 1 of the 2 best film dancers ever and debbie reynolds worked very well, despite complications that arose off the set. and donald oconnor was born for his role as cosmo brown, the best buddy to kellys don lockwood. his wit keeps the film fresh and funny. if you took a drink for every smart remark he made, youd be drunk, before lockwood gets the girl! all the characters in this film are dynamic, save cosmo brown and lena lamont played by jean hagen. this was perfect for what was called for, for this film to succeed. this helps the film move, where other musicals fail. this is where the irony enters since this film was written in reverse of this philosophy. being able to incorporate quality songs into a quality storyline is a skill no studio has ever mastered, even to this day. even, mgm, which was known as the king of the musicals, failed more often than it succeeded. to this day, no one has mastered it although disney has almost reached mgm proportions with its animation department. as the film opens, the premiere for one of the famed lockwoodlamont films is taking place for the royal rascal. as the stars arrive, one by one, cosmo brown arrives. a bit later lockwood and lamont arrive. lockwood tells a story of how he and cosmo get to stardom. to celebrate the release, there is a party at the studios producers house. but to get there, lockwood must go by a different rout than everyone else, finding kathy selden debbie reynolds in the process. after a few cute surprises and accidents, don gets a conscience attack. after finally finding her, he realizes that he cares for her. meanwhile, cosmo brown keeps up his antics and funny nature. the comic relief is never amiss in this film. lamont soon learns of the romance and is up to something, but what? what do you think she is, .dumb or something? the codirector also codirected by gene kelly stanley donen called the moses supposes dance sequence with kelly and oconnor, the best dance sequence ever. i agree that it is in the top 3, but not the best, thats in another film which donen directed, for another review. all numbers in this film are memorable, where most from other films are not. there is only one detraction in this film. it is the broadway melody sequence. it begins with another interesting and amusing song and dance number by mr. lockwood, trying to convince his producer of something. but the scene becomes too long and unnecessary. cyd charisse is an amazing talent, but the dance number she has in the film, should have been deleted. it is mesmerizing, but is out of place in this film. this 13 minute sequence should have ended at about 78 max. still, this detail is so minute, that it isnt a bad detraction. when this film was released in 1952, it opened to lukewarm reviews and average box office receipts. it wasnt until its 10th anniversary, that people began to notice that singin in the rain was special and has been known as such ever since. the afi, when it released its list of the 100 greatest films ever, ranked this film no.10, to put it at the highest mark for a musical of any era and place ms. debbie reynolds as half of the only motherdaughter combination on the list. singin in the rain, is always fun to watch, the film has also been recently released on dvd with tons of extras. as enduring as mr. kellys lamppost lean is, so this film echoes mr. lockwoods sentiments of nothing nothing but pure joy that is. personal rating 99 on a 100 point scale notems. reynolds daughter, carrie fisher appeared in afis no. 15 film, star wars.",positive

"the boys really turns the superhero biz inside out. hilariously disgusting adventures abound, yet theres still a lot of heart to the show. great characters character dynamics. antony starr as homelander is brilliant. i really love seasons 1 2. season 3 is also excellent. the vibe is slightly different, but still super enjoyable. i dont know what to make of season 4. it had been a well balanced show there were always political parallels but they were more in the background. they gave the show a nice bit of weight without being too in your face. that balance is off in season 4. also, most of the characters have been given depressing storylines where did all the fun go? half the show feels onbrand delivers all the craziness, filth brutality you have come to expect. the other half feels very soap operaish with abundant lame blah blah blah. im guessing that scripts were rushed through as a result of last years writers strike. in the past the boys would avoid such cliche stuff. hopefully things recover in season 5 so the boys can go out with a great final season!",positive
"this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. the movie drags on to say the least. im not sure why i sat through the entire movie, but all i wanted it to do was end. not only is this movie not entertaining, but the plot was anxiety producing. the poor guy who was supposed to take care of his baby is basically psychologically tortured the entire movie. another thing that really annoyed about this movie is the scene where the mask character dances. in the original movie this scene is hilarious. this movie tries to recreate that and fails miserably. the only thing i can do at this point is to tell you to never, i repeat, never watch this movie. its just going to get you angry and make you want to smash your t.v.",negative

i will try to be brief but frank but the bottom line is this film is a car crash. well published financial muddling at production company level led to production troubles and massive budget cuts and what became superman 4 runs for just 89 minutes including titles with 40 minutes left on the cutting room floor. what is on screen looks cheap with poor story telling and rotten special effects and the nuclear man story carries no punch it is simply tame and lame. as a fan of the original i remember well taking in the movie at my old local cinema and leaving bitterly disappointed i had not seen the movie since until i watched this blue ray and time had not improved any of it. christopher reeve does the best he can in the circumstances and the john williams theme music is as good as ever but this is a very poor movie that audiences at the time mostly avoided and wisely for superman 4 with its pretentious quest for peace serves only as an example of how not to make a movie.,positive
"of course wayans would delve in a spoof and farce on the success of fifty shades of grey. and it is, of course, done in the very same formula and routine that every other wayans spoof is done, so there is no deviation to be expected here. and with the fact established that the very same, and too often abused, formula applied to the movie, you can expect very little in terms of originality, concept or surprises. so if you are a big fan of the numerous other wayans spoofs, then chances are very high that you will enjoy this one too. but personally, then i think that formula has been worn down to the bone and it is time for wayans to go back to the creative corner and come up with something new. the end result that is fifty shades of black turned out to be not particularly funny. sure, there were some good laughs here and there throughout the course of the movie, because of the jokes or the situations. but in overall, then this was a very generic and flaccid movie, which could have been a lot more funnier with some more creative and original writing. i will actually go as far as saying that if you have seen any one of the many previous wayans spoofs, then you have essentially also already seen fifty shades of black. now, i havent seen the fifty shades of grey movie, nor read the book, and i have no intention to do so. so how much or how little fifty shades of black stays true to the original source material. however, all in all, then fifty shades of black was just another generic spoof comedy that failed to stand out or leave any real lasting impression.",negative
"deadpool 3 is an absolute riot! it successfully blends the irreverent, fourthwallbreaking humor of the previous deadpool films with the largerthanlife spectacle of the marvel cinematic universe. what works ryan reynolds and hugh jackman their onscreen chemistry is electric. reynolds delivers his signature snarky wit, while jackman brings a gruff charm to wolverine that perfectly complements deadpools antics. actionpacked the film doesnt skimp on the action. the fight scenes are brutal and entertaining, with deadpools signature overthetop violence. humor the jokes land consistently, with plenty of metahumor, pop culture references, and unexpected twists. mcu integration deadpools entry into the mcu is handled with cleverness and respect for both the character and the franchise. what could be improved plot while the story is serviceable, it takes a backseat to the characters and the action. pacing the film could have benefited from a tighter edit in some places. overall, deadpool 3 is a mustwatch for fans of the character and the mcu alike. its a refreshing departure from the typical superhero fare and a testament to the power of a wellexecuted rrated film.",positive
"i never saw the broadway show and did not know the story ahead of time. i already had my ticket before reading the reviews. i do not agree with the reviews of it being garbage and i am not sure why people said they were waiting for an orgy. there was nothing sexual about it. the cast was very talented but my opinion of the movie is that it was extremely boring. the costuming of the heads and faces were very unique and it was all a bit strange looking, especially the tails, but believe me, there are a lot of talentless garbage movies out there, this was not one of them.",negative
"i must admit that i havent seen slacker, linklaters previous look at 1976 high school, but i was impressed that a very peculiar time of cultural history has not been forgotten indeed, has been immortalized, high school and the sociological angst of teenagers. because the teen years are a joke to begin with, even tragedy seems perversely amusing through the looking glass of time. the boys resemble david cassidy, or roger staubach. the girls all look like stevi nicks. the patter is accurate with stoner kids talking like black folks sort of. im high man, so high, blah, black, pass the bong. you get the idea. the hazing incidents, boys getting paddled, girls getting slimed, seem to be a small town, midwestern ritual, im not familiar with in my secure east coast cottage, but i thought it was fascinating when the senior, dominatrix in training chick, whips the little freshman girls into shape, hmm, perverse. every teen film has to have a party and these kids get bombed outdoors, a massive jagger and bong fest. one of the last scenes, a romance on a blanket was unexpected, and i will not spoil it. is there anything new or important here to learn about kids or their world? no, not much, but film is amusing at times, and it certainly nails a time and place. watch for future stars like ben affleck.",positive

"the office is by far one of the greatest and most relatable series of our time. it is in my opinion that when a british show is adapted for the american market, the unique dry british humour often gets lost in translation and you are left with a product which doesnt feel quite right. quite frankly, it can feel as a show has been dumbed down to appeal to a wider audience whether or not this is actually true or just a prejudiced opinion on american television by foreign audiences. admittedly, the office takes a few episodes or even, the whole first series to find its voice and separate itself from its predecessor and ricky gervais. i tell my friends who have not yet seen the show and have been living under a rock for the last few years to stick with the awkwardness because ultimately, the payoff is truly worth it. the characters feel so relatable, as though it is you or i sitting in an office in a dying industry working for an incompetent and utterly clueless boss. there is something really beautiful in something which is seemingly so ordinary. steve carells sweet and innocent portrayal of michael scott makes you want the best for him. his constant yearning for acceptance against the backdrop of his journey to find true love with his soul mate tugs at your heartstrings. jim and pams courtship is the slowburn love story for the ages, and it certainly helps that john krasinski and jenna fischer both have that adorable, cheeky boygirl next door appeal. rainn wilson lights up the entire office with his powerful and hilarious portrayal of the lawabiding, hardworking assistant to the regional manager dwight schrute. but its dwights softer moments that i appreciate the most. a particular scene between dwight and jim on the stairwell comes to mind where the men connect for a brief and sympathetic moment to share their mutual understanding on how painful heartbreak can really feel. the casting department really got it right for this show, and it is obvious that the cast genuinely had a fun time during shooting which creates an undeniable cast chemistry which was ultimately instrumental in the shows global success. special mention episode threat level midnight special mention quote i wish there was a way to know youre in the good old days, before youve actually left them. someone should write a song about that. andy bernard",positive

"full disclosure i am a roman catholic, raised by devout parents and taught by dedicated clergy. i happen to subscribe to the view that the war on christmas is part of a larger, not necessarily connected, movement whose chief side effect is to eliminate or diminish the chief underpinnings and foundations of western judeochristian society. lawsuits against nativity displays are, to me, the handiwork of unhappy zealots. having said all that, this film was earnest but profoundly flawed. first, i didnt appreciate the swipe against the catholic churchs hierarchy bishops with high hats and scepters during the st. nicholas segment. i do like the st. nicholas story, but it was contrived here with the original st. nicholas doing a hohoho i am not kidding just before being told by his assistant to start the deliveries presumably of gifts. second, if indeed the simplicity of the original nativity is to be stressed, with jesus born to mary and joseph in a cave, laid in a feeding manger, then perhaps they should have cast a mary who had not just had her nails done. there they were, as mary was holding the christ child, each nail impeccable and painted. and their garments? perfectly clean, even looking like theyd just been ironed. third, dont direct so that we can see the direction. head turns, puzzled looks, earnest looks . . . i shouldnt be hearing in my head the directors exact stage directions. ok, look right at him then turn away. fourth, this was not about saving christmas. this was about explaining our modern celebration of it its already been saved, judging from the frequent references to it being celebrated the world over. i liked noah. i liked narnia. i like the hobbit movies. i did not like this one.",negative

moana 2 is disneys studios latest film which is visually stunning but lacks the story to back it up. it feels like disney just created this to gain more money from the box office instead of really crafting a story that would resonate with audiences just like the first film did. the movie speeds by pretty quickly but cant say there was one scene that was memorable. all of our actors do a fine job here but still cant save this one from being just mediocre. even the returns from the box office were not the strongest and is a sign that disney has to be careful with their future theatrical releases. moana 2 gets a 7 out of 10 star rating from me.,negative

"you would think with all the accumulated earnings the wayans brothers, shawn and marlon, have obtained after being on television and in films for years that they would invest their money and their time in projects that would be a bit more thoughtful and entertaining. instead, ever since the runaway success of a haunted house in 2013, the two, particularly marlon, have been keen on making movies that fit the bill for the lowest common denominator of entertainment. fifty shades of black, a horribly obvious and persistently unfunny array of cheapshots at the erotic novelfilm series that is already too easy to joke about, continues marlons streak and incredible failing to make something out of his baby way productions company. ive always found it interesting that while tyler perrys films are anything but consistent, and there are about an equal number of bad films in his catalog as good films, he often gets blamed for making films about black people that cater to the lowest common denominator and showcase them in a negative light, yet the recent collaborations of marlon wayans and michael tiddes go pretty much unscathed. these are films that evoke some of the most putrid and ugly stereotypes about nearly every race and, for that matter, exist simply as unapologetically crude and contrived projects that do nothing but attempt to evoke laughs based on brandrecognition. these films are just a slight notch above the dreaded works of jason friedberg and aaron seltzer. as hinted, fifty shades of black is a parody of fifty shades of grey, and it takes pretty much the safest, most convenient route to parody the film by making the jokes largely centered around the absurdity of bdsm and its culture, race and ethnic humor, the ordinariness and ugliness of its lead female character, and the enigma surrounding its titular character, who in this case, is christian black marlon wayans. christian is a multimillionaire mogul who begins a sexual relationship with his new intern, hannah steale kali hawk and what entails is a relationship filled with sex, sexual violence, and downright bizarre encounters. while whatever adam sandler and his happy madison gang is cooking up this year is likely to get plenty of razzie nominations, marlon wayans and his cast of familiar faces such as affion crockett, missi pyle, mike epps, fred willard, and more should be looking at the same award. its incredibly rare to see a cast ostensibly operate on autopilot and look like the end product bearing some essence of quality is the furthest thing from their minds, but perhaps given the lazy screen writing of rick alvarez and wayans himself, this was to be expected. shockingly enough, fifty shades of black offers more laughs than both of the haunted house films put together, especially during a sequence that parodies one of last years best picture contenders at the academy awards. however, in order to get to this sequence, one has to succumb to the drudgery of enough racial and bathroom humor so much that it gives laura mulveys concept of phallocentrism a whole different angle to explore that it ultimately isnt worth sitting through the amount of trivial nonsense to get to that particular scene. were not even in february yet and this year has already been incredibly interesting for comedies. after seeing ride along 2, i didnt think many more comedies of the year would get much worse than that. then i saw dirty grandpa the following week and i thought the same thing there was most likely the weakest comedy of 2016 that i would have to sit through. now, almost exactly a week later, ive seen fifty shades of black, and if this isnt the worst comedy of 2016, i seriously fear what i have to endure in the coming eleven months.",negative
"at first look, this series looks like it will be almost impossibly stupid and clich ridden the american rube and the heartless dowager but impossibly hot! butt heads over the soul of an ailing football club. you soon bear witness to the fact that the only thing this has in common with other coachteam fairy tales is that they lose games and then start winning. but as ted lasso points out repeatedly in his homespun wisdom, the games they play on the grass dont mean a fraction compared to the lives of the people affected. if ever people needed a heartwarming and lifeaffirming yes, i said lifeaffirming, and i dont even know what that means story, it would be in 2020. ted lasso doesnt have a cynical or sarcastic bone in his body, and viewers will very quickly be won over to his way of playing and living. i could have done without any of the jokes about how little he knows about football. not many of them were funny and some were just annoying. thankfully, these were few and evaporated quickly as the story got up on its own two legs and ran away from the original tv commercial gag. i just watched e07 last night and i couldnt even believe how badly i needed what ted lasso is selling. after a tough day reading the news, the show went down like good medicine. ive never had that experience from watching a tv show before. can we have more, please? i hope this starts a trend towards this type of programming. dont get me wrong, i love gangster movies and crime stories, but there are so very few stories out there telling us that we really need to treat each other better. i see movie posters on bus stops and almost every one of them has some guyor guyswith a gunor guns. there should be a law against peddling this trash in public. you cant have a porno movie poster at a bus stop, yet almost everyone has sex which is a perfectly normal part of life, so why should movies selling violence have such free reign over our public spaces?",positive

"loved the first two seasons. great chemistry between the actors, loved the ridiculous nature of the plot and the shocking twists. the actors hearts were in the project and it showed. season 3 is the complete opposite. you have to force yourself to watch the show hoping that something interesting will happen. the characters are unlikeable and you cant empathize with a single one of them. there is no chemistry between any of them. the acting is sub par and they all seem to be over acting especially the three old women. i suppose nothing to be surprised here. this is just another cash grab trying to ride off the success of the first two seasons. if you are curious about what happens, i would recommend reading the plots on wikipedia rather than wasting 8 hours on this borefest.",positive
"the day before watching this series i finally watched a series about awful rich people called succession that folks were raving about on twitter, and didnt like it at all. the next day, coincidentally, i saw another series about awful, reasonably rich folk, the righteous gemstones, and it had all the fun and humor id been promised from succession. from the first scene, in which a mass baptism in a swimming pool turns into a splash fight, i loved this series. the series is about a family that runs a megachurch consisting of stern patriarch john goodman and his three adultinnameonly children. theyre varying levels of awful, the worst being the godlyinnameonly jesse gemstone, played by series creator danny mcbride, who spends the episode dealing with blackmail in a pretty psychopathic manner. the series does have some issues with tone and consistency. the series wants to get every laugh out of its characters outrageous behavior but then will give them moments of humanity that dont always feel organic. this is most noticeable in attempts to slightly soften jesse towards the end of the first season. still, great performances, fun characters, lots of laughs. definitely check this out.",positive

"a disaster. just unfunny nonsense. there is an unending sequence of awful jokes with no relevance for the story story?!. it could be just one more spoof movie that gets references from the most popular films of the moment. most of those parodies are bad movies and this could be just one of them. though, disater movie was able to be placed among the worst of them as it mixes films which have no relation to each other 10,000 bc, juno, no country for old men, wanted, high school musical, sex and the city, indiana jones, the chronicles of narnia, jumper, enchanted, alvin and the chipmunks, speed racer, night at the museum, beowulf, kung fu panda..., and there is no clever idea to make it works as something reasonable that makes sense. it is not the number of referenced movies that makes a parody good. there are some superheroes, like hancock, iron man, hellboy, the hulk, batman... but believe me, they will not save the day! dont waste your time, just do not watch this messy crap.",negative

"the great white goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.this bonechilling movie based on the peter benchleys novel and written by richard matheson and carl gottlieb screenwriter of the trilogy , it packs some exciting scenes, thrills, chills and lousy direction. the film is developed at florida in a seaside park , while the previous entries are set at in new england in a shore community named amity .there ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. an underwater world that contains restaurant, cafeteria, aquarium and several other things.the sons dennis quaid and john putch of police chief brody roy scheider, lorraine gary jaws i,ii attempt to convince the park owner louis gossett jr who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. then, an adventurer named phillipsimon maccorkindale and his helper determine to track down and kill it. the protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation. its an inferior following with average creation of tension,thrills,terror, emotions and brief gore. the story gets little relation to first two jaws, except by father sheriff brody and sons relationship. the argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to revenge of the creaturejack arnold in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. the shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by alan parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master john williams prized with an oscar who heightens the suspense. this below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star, dennis quaid, bess armstrong, louis gossett jr, john putch and lea thompson formerly to back to the future . regular cinematography by james a contner subsequently filmmaker and is badly directed by joe alves, producer designer of the original film. while the classic picture by spielberg obtained three oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic, its tree sequels are much worst, and were respectively directed by jeannot swarc,joe alves and joseph sargent in annoying direction. rating bottom of barrel, a real turkey. only for theaters, its real asset are the 3d digital effects, for that reason in television lost their spectacular tridimensional qualities.",negative
"greetings again from the darkness. billy wilders classic was the latest in the comedy series sponsored by dallas film society and dallas morning news. it is almost always ranked as one of the top comedy films of alltime, and often the best ever. while thats a bit higher than i would rank it, there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place in cinematic history. to fully understand the impact of the film, it helps to remind yourself of the times ... it was filmed more than 50 years ago. what we might call tame today, was incredibly risqu and daring for the times. what really stands out while watching the film is just what an incredible screen presence marilyn monroe possessed. it is quite challenging to take your eyes off her during any of her scenes. i am at a loss to come up with any other actor or actress who even comes close to this level of cameracornering. greta garbo and marlon brando were great, but marilyn is transcendent while on screen. of course, the reports of her personal issues are legendary. supposedly on this film, she was constantly 23 hours late, couldnt remember her lines and had to be coddled by all involved. still, the final product is stunning and director billy wilder understood that no other actress could be substituted. sadly, marilyn only made two more films and was dead 3 years after this film was released. as wonderful as marilyn is, this is really the story of joe and jerry, or josephine and daphne, or even junior. those five characters are all played with crackling comedy timing by tony curtis and jack lemmon. lemmon, as daphne, is especially terrific as he tangos the night away with osgood fielding iii played by joe e brown. curtis is at his best when courting marilyns sugar kane while sporting his cary grant impersonation and driving the boat backwards. there are so many classic comedy moments in this film, and though it is based on a 1935 french farce titled fanfare damour, wilder and his cowriter and frequent collaborator i.a.l. diamond made it their own by adding the gangster story line. seeing notorious movie bad guy george raft tied to the 1929 chicago st valentines day massacre adds a dimension that many writersdirectors would be unable to handle. instead, wilder adds his frenetic dialogue and mixes in some wild doubleentendres, a touch of marx brothers, and the sensuous singing of marilyn to deliver a world class comedy. the florida scenes were filmed at the historical hotel del coronado in san diego, which remains a very popular resort location even today. marilyn sings i wanna be loved by you and im through with love in such a way that her characters naivety adds a dimension that breaks the heart of joe curtis and mesmerizes the viewer. billy wilder is certainly one of the hollywood giants and delivered such classics as sunset blvd, the apartment, irma ladouce, and witness for the prosecution. his excellence spans numerous film genres, and we admire his patience and proficiency in juggling the issues required to pull off some like it hot ... and avoid the fuzzy end of the lollipop.",positive
"we often take one of those seasonal television specials very much for granted. the familiarity that they build up after several annual showings often becomes confused with their being commonplace. hence their reputations or our automatic pigeonholing of their quality and compatibility of their relationship with their audiences tend to play down the significance they actually do posses. in short, we pay little attention to these specials and give them little, if any real appreciation. as a sterling example, when a charlie brown christmas mendelsonmelendez prod.charles m. schultz assoc.united features syndicate, 1965 first arrived at cbs for its maiden voyage, some of the columbianas broadcasticus idioticus network executives decided that the film had poor animation, flat background artwork, inadequate music, a shallow storyline and dared to do a reading from gospels by linus in explanation of just what christmas was all about. of course, these execs were all wet and we know what a success and annual treasure a charlie brown christmas has become. in the time honored television tradition of sincerity being the sincerest form of flattery, master animator chuck jones did the screen adaptation of the dr. seuss theodore geisel classic how the grinch stole chistmas mgm television, 1966. the problems were similar to those of the peanuts gang production of a year earlier, but somewhat more complex. as the charlie brown project was very much a literal translation of the peanuts comic strip, right from newspaper page to tv screen, the screenplay was an original one, though extended in length. it effectively knit many little daily comic striplike vignettes, all woven around the central theme of christmastime, the school play and charlie browns eternal efforts to achieve approval from his peers. in direct contrast, chuck jones co. faced a oneshot only story which is the grinch. there was never any other story up to that time, at least with which to incorporate into a screen story. they only had the original dr. seuss master work with which to develop the film. but how does one accomplish such a feat? to start with, the services of veteran character actor, william henry pratt, whose career had roots on the stage of preworld war i britain, canada and the united states extending to the years in silent films in both america britain, then to the early days of the talkies and down to that then present day in the 1960s. his roles had included hostile indian chiefs, renegade englishman in foreboding equatorial environs or as some of the most horrifying characters on the screen including the crazyquilt assemblage of parts culled from cadavers by one dr, frankenstein. we all know him better by his professional name of boris karloff 18871969 and its hard to get just what his connection could possibly be to any kids stories. but the fact of the matter is that he had for some time been successful with less than ghosts, goblins and things that go bump in the night. his interpretation of captain hook on stage in peter pan led to his doing some spoken word records of children stories and the like, which may well have brought mr. karloff to the grinch project. and he may well have been the perfect choice to not only voice the portrayal, but also to do the extensive narration, which was essentially the recital of the very familiar dr. seuss work. but again, that was not enough to fill the half hour 26 minutes the commercials a full hour of primetime, then anyway!. so something would have to be done to add and not pad the original story. this was accomplished by adding some seussian shenanigans for the inhabitants of whoville to perform with the music playing. added to this is some original songs, featuring the rich, bass tones of the prolific and well known by voice of one thurl ravenscroft 19142005. who? we hear you ask. mr. ravenscroft had about as prolific a career as any vocalist in the films. we have spotted him in some mgm musicals and he got plenty of work from mr. walt disney, whenever a really deep voice was needed in an animated picture, he was the guy. he had been a member of the sportsman quartet, which was a mainstay on the jack benny program for years both on radio and on the telly. he was also a member of the mello men and was at the heart of creating the harmonizing canines in the dog pound in lady and the tramp walt disney prod.buena vista, 1954 in which he also provided voices of al the dog and the alligator in the zoo. so the television film of how the grinch stole christmas was sort of stretched by use of the youre a mean old man mr. grinch song. stretched into a true delight and christmastime classic. thats more than we can say for that feature of how the grinch stole christmas imagine ent.luni prod.universal pictures, 2000 with jim carrey which went on for 107 minutes and cot ome big buck!",positive

"as i type this, this movie sits at 83 on the alltime greatest movies list. almost makes me guilty for only giving it a 7 and possibly dropping it to 84, but to be honest it wasnt the greatest movie ive ever seen. but it also wasnt the worst. paul newman and robert redford are two confidence men con men or grifters in the 1930s who cheat at cards. they cheat at cards against a wealthy new york city man and then sucker him in for what is called a long con or big con. if you like the character sawyer from lost, this is probably your movie. the whole second half of the movie is this long con and will they pull it off? you wont know until the end, because the mafia and the fbi are both trying to kill them. and sometimes happy endings happen when the cops win and the cheaters lose. so dont bet on any horses until you know the score. anyway, its a good film. some parts are hard to follow in my opinion, but in a twisted sense this makes sense if they are conning the other cons, surely we the audience should be getting conned, too. it would be shoddy con work to let in anybody, even the audience. and the acting is of course perfect because its newman and redford. but also the guy from my favorite martian walston and james earl jones father. so, thats good. they claim the music really makes the film. i disagree. the music is appropriate, but not because it matches the 1940s. because it matches the cards used to separate the different scenes which, by the way, i think was a great idea. to cut a review short that isnt going anywhere, this film is recommended. not highly recommended. not top 100 films of all time recommended. but you might want to see it anyway.",positive

"what do you get with a a list cast, phenomenal special effects and amazing soundtrack..... ? unfortunately a snails narrative and abysmal viewing experience. i understand this was produced to be a children friendly story but wtf! when characters cant emote all live action characters phonein their performances and every scene requires exposition i think you have a story and script that shouldnt have been greenlit, let alone spend the hundreds of millions in order to create what will go down as arguably one the most forgettable movies of the last 30 years. im writing this 10 minutes after watching and i can barely remember what happened in an excruciatingly slow movie that had all the elements that should have the moniker modern classic, but sadly have more in common with the brown stuff on the bottom of my shoe. nothing against millie bobby brown, but the reality is she cant carry a production because she really cant and never has. ive never been able to put my finger on exactly as to why, other than the fact she is always miscast and i struggle to believe her in her roles because she makes wrong choices and is either wooden or chews up the room and becomes unlikeable. the russos absolutely overplay the emotion in this, forcing it down our throats constantly backed by an alternate version of a famous song a method so overdone in modern cinema its becoming a turn off, try to be way political riddled with allegory and innuendo and fail on every level. the cast have horrible plot armor and you barely care for any of the characters plight no matter what happens. im genuinely not sure what the goal of this production, where the keys simply offered on the back of russos past marvel success and will they become the modern day wachowkis unable to rekindle the success? hopefully without requiring gender reassignment this is simply because its an absolute triple fail, not entertaining, not memerable and the message doesnt hit. all i can say is the electric state is an absolute flat line highlighted with possibly the worst song ive heard over the credits with the flaming lips boredom inducing yoshimi battles with pink robots pt 1.... talk about leaving the audience depressed and miserable.",positive

"far cry is the film version of a popular video game that i know nothing about. however, i do know something about the career of infamous german director uwe boll, a man responsible for the likes of bloodrayne and alone in the dark, and commonly thought of as one of our worst modern directors. im pleased to report that far cry is by far the best boll film ive thus watched its no masterpiece, thats for sure, but its reasonably entertaining, unlike the majority of his output. the film contains all of the ingredients usual for a bollstyle bmovie an ensemble cast of fading faces, lots of low rent action, some cheesy effects and the like, and plenty of clich. however, this time around that mix is quite fun. til schweiger, the german actor who rose to international prominence after his part in tarantinos inglourious basterds, is fine as the likable and humorous hero, and emmanuelle vaugier and natalia avelon are suitably attractive female costars. this film is a germancanadian coproduction which is quite convincing when it comes to the styling. the action scenes are fairly well done and certainly you often see bmovie shootouts that are done far worse than the ones here. some of the oldtimer actors playing tough guys include don s. davis, craig fairbrass, udo kier, michael pare, and ralf moeller. the plot is your usual nonsense about a mad scientist creating an army of super soldiers and the one or two soldiers we do get to see here are pretty impressive, coming across as a zombie version of the ones in universal soldier. anyway, far cry is no great shakes as a film, but it is a reasonably entertaining bmovie nonetheless.",negative
"i mean, honestly! this is supposed to be a kiddie flick, right? so, in classic disney fashion...five minutes in, two days short of hatching, mum is devoured by a barracuda along with 499 of our title characters siblings. why??? this movie made me squirm pun only gently intended. i cant remember a time ive been more uncomfortable watching a film so blatantly marketed at children. im a playwright, folks, an awardwinning one at that. i get the concept of conflict as a dramatic device...but must we keep our cutesypoo lead in constant peril sharks, nets, aquarium filtration systems, etc. im really disappointed in how gratuitously manipulative this feature is, and saddened that the filmmakers think so very little of the audience to foist such drivel on us, disguised as a family film. sure, it was lovely to look at...but i cant say much more in its favor. i would never recommend this unnecessarily violent, surprisingly distressing, unintentionally maudlin, unbearably sentimental movie for a child or an adult. why this film continues to rake it in at the box office, and why critics predict this as an oscar favorite is beyond my abliity to understand. im no crochety grump, either well, at least i wasnt before i watched this dreadful film. this is just another classic example of disney lackeys putting formula ahead to story and sense, all in pursuit of the bucks. walt must be spinning in his cryogenic chamber at the thought of his name being sullied by association with this horrible film. parents do your kids a favor if they love the little fishies...take them to a real aquarium instead of subjecting them to even one minute of this bizarre and misguided cash cow with mouse ears. i want the last two hours of my life back.",positive

"the first part somehow managed to wriggle out of the sewer which is designed to lift and unusually big deal, although it does not offer anything except ideas. however, when the dust settled he raised, the floor remained considerable amount of money, and the second part was a logical move. on the other hand, its continuation can fit in one name laurence harvey. this madman and his role carrying the entire movie. i would not be surprised if a man is truly a psychopath, just look at his face and you will agree with me, and the fact that this is his first film role in life can only confirm this. indeed, one at a time creates a feeling of pity in the viewer, and you simply want to succeed in his attempt. however, there is another fact this film is not able to keep the tension of the already tepid first part. there are small crafts that hold the attention, there are scenes that trigger stomach, but the whole point of the film is reduced to the psycho succeed in its intent, which is likely to represent the first and only success in his life. if you liked the first part, youll love this one, definitely. extra the slogan that accompanied the film is 100 medically inaccurate, unlike the first who wore a 100 medically accurate.",negative
"every major cult film fan has watched dunyayi kurtaran adam man who saves the world aka turkish star wars. quarter a century after that was released ,we get a sequel dunyayi kurtaran adamin oglu son of the man who saves the world. while the original was meant to be a serious science fiction adventure, this one attempts to be a parody of the old film and various other science fiction films in the vein of g.o.r.a. needless to say, the result is cinematic sewage. the film is a basically a serious of gags , none of which are close to being remotely funny. the acting is even worse. erbil has already sealed his spot in the acting hall of shame with the lame shrekwannabe keloglan he was even worse than petek dincoz, which should tell you how amazingly bad he was. cuneyt arkin seems to be sleepwalking. sinem kobal who is one of the most promising young turkish actresses working today, would want to erase this off her resume for her careers sake. the sad news is that this film actually did well at the box office, so we will soon be hit with the inevitable sequel. lets hope that it completely flops so that the public is spared from another 2 hours of garbage.",negative
one of bolls better attempts. just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. the main difference between bloodrayne and farcry really is that the story from farcry wasnt the games strong point whereas bloodrayne had a strong story and thus boll had more chance to mess it up. the action in this movie is actually fairly good. occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that. acting wise it was pretty decent. most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they arent taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps. while i think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. especially given the plot of the game was hardly oscar winning just a vehicle for fps carnage. would have liked it set in the jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but canada doesnt have a great deal of jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest. why boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots i dont know but he does. and until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.,negative
"a difficult assessment. a typical romcom, although its not really one, but then somehow also a special film, a tightrope act between having seen it 1000 times and having its very own touch. the latter is mainly due to the very good cast, both main actors with full throttle and obvious heart and soul, as well as the right chemistry. in the best phases, what is shown scratches at the indie film, unrealistic feelings are never served up, artificial gag fireworks are never attempted. 100 relatively fresh and undoubtedly refreshing summer minutes, with some memorable moments. i think no hard feelings could stand the test of time and stick, what speaks against it is only the quantity of outputs in these genre realms.",positive

"few movies in the history of movies inspire its fans to memorize every scene, every bit of dialogue, every microscopic nuance to be brought out later at social gatherings. such is monty python and the holy grail. the pythoners once said in an interview that when they wrote their characters, their scripts, it was never about what they thought would make millions of people laugh. it was about what made the six of them laugh, and that is a fitting testament to pythons genius. john cleese once commented that the british are a people who are desperate to be made fun of. when many people think of england, the first images most people the world over conjure up are either the horrible weather or the stuffed shirts that make up the aristocracy. the best british comedies through the years. python, benny hill and the black adder series, to name a few, were all made immortal because they railed against the stiff, boring world they grew up in by displaying the wacky irreverence that made even the status quo laugh. the knights who say nee! the french taunter. the castle anthrax. the rabbit. lancelots stint at swamp castle. bring out your dead. the bridge keeper. you mention these things to people, and they instantly know what you mean, even if the name of the movie hasnt even come up! but even the smaller bits are worthy of remembrance the opening credits. the coconuts. the witch trial. sir robins minstrels. the old man clapping on the dungeon wall. the 10second psych! intermission. the holy hand grenade. and the aptly named sirnotappearinginthisfilm. the list goes on and on. every second of this movie belongs in the comedy hall of fame. id bet that his film is on more peoples top 10 funniest movies of all time than any other. it has become a standard in the industry. strange women lying in ponds... bet youre gay! no im not... i got better... ...silly english knnnnnnniggets run away! run away! well, perhaps ill stay a bit longer... we want.... a shrubbery!! 10 out of 10.",positive

"the very first film from 1984 was visually stunning and of good quality with a memorable title tune. the quality sunk a bit with the sequel, the neverending story ii the next chapter and then things get worse with this 3rd trip to fantasia. the whole thing looks cheap and comes nowhere close to what the very first two films offered. its bottomofthebarrel filmmaking with a focus placed on the real world this time to obviously fit the low budget. jason james richter is okay as bastian bux though he stumbles through the whole story with uncertainty and acts lost for most of the time. hes never sure of what he should do next. his new stepsister turns out to be a resentful brat with a sour attitude while his meek new stepmother constantly acts selfconscious about how to properly treat him. theres also a continuity error with bastians father who became aware of the magic book and fantasia in the second film, but mysteriously doesnt know about it in this one. the one character to really stand out though was jack black as the evil leader of the nasties. he really is a good actor and thats apparent in this film where he conveys a highly menacing presence bent on taking control of the magical powers of fantasia for his own devious purposes. he and his gang of misfits wouldve been better suited though in a postapocalyptic thriller in the same vein as mad max instead of in this lame grated flick. they cause all sorts of mayhem here as school bullies and as possessors of the book of power, but the goal of what theyre trying to accomplish out of all that isnt made clear. what other benefits could they have wanted out of the magic besides causing chaos? thats all they seemingly wanted to do. the characters from fantasia are also not up to standard. falkor the dragon is depicted as dimwitted and goofy this time around while those two nagging gnomes are just apparently there for irritation purposes. that mischievous baby rock is also downright annoying, but the tree man is bearable. they all accidentally get taken to the real world with bastian and, wouldnt you know, halloween conveniently happens so they could all pretend theyre trick or treaters in costumes. its not surprising this film wasnt a very successful one. i recall seeing one quick preview on tv about its theatrical release in the 1990s and it did look quite good from that brief glimpse, but then it suddenly wasnt playing anymore. i can now see why it had a limited run. its no surprise that a neverending story iv hasnt appeared afterwards. this low grade installment and its subsequent failure is obviously the reason why. a fresh reboot of the series just might happen again someday though.",negative

"clearly created both by and for a generation that has grown up deeply embedded in video games, love, death robots inevitably seems to reflect a similar drop in attention span and a curiously singleminded focus on surface shocks and flashy spectacle at the expense of everything else. indeed, the storylines and animation often feel like little more than intros to games, with as much depth, believability and emotion. the visuals are, admittedly, continually impressive, but theres really almost nothing at all supporting them the dialogue is lame, cliched and forgettable throughout, the storytelling very weak, practically every joke falls flat, and the voice acting is gratingly amateurish more often than not. its clear comparisons will be drawn between this and, say, black mirror, in that they are both comprised of short, standalone stories dealing mostly with technology and the future, but unlike black mirror, at no point does any episode make you think deeply about... well, anything, and no idea raised is fleshed out enough to feel youve been shown anything of any worth. the good news is that, since the episodes are only 15 minutes long anyway, you dont feel particularly cheated, at least at first, but after youve watched a bunch of them, you do begin to wonder what the point of it all is. the better episodes are the witness, suits and shapeshifters, so id recommend checking those out first if curious.",positive

"disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. thank god for pixar coming to existence. starting with toy story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. they havent failed since. they can do no wrong it seems, and i pray it continues that way. of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. it is also arguably better than any animated film disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. the premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. it never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. tom hanks and tim allen have become iconic in their roles as woody and buzz. the animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. the supporting characters are also very good and funny. with animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. overall, toy story is superb filmmaking with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. thank you, pixar. i am truly grateful to you for saving animated films.",positive

"the intouchables three and a half stars out of five a french comedydrama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time. its also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 academy award nomination due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win. the film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little overhyped. its a good movie but it is clichd and somewhat simple and unoriginal. its been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. it does seem like the type of movie eddie murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with dustin hoffman because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to dustin hoffman. the film stars francois cluzet as an aristocrat, named philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. hes somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter elisa alba gaia kraghede bellugi. he also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. he maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. one day hes looking for a new caretaker and a man named driss omar sy enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a parisian suburb. so when philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has its own large bathtub in it, its quite a culture shock for him. of course philippe is inspired by driss and both mens lives are forever changed. the film was written and directed by olivier nakache and eric toledano. it is nicely directed and looks beautiful. it also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. its just that the film isnt that funny or that emotionally moving. the performances are fine, it has some good laughs and its a good well intentioned story but its nothing we havent seen before and far from anything spectacular. its enormous success does puzzle me a little but id much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like twilight. so its definitely a decent crowdpleasing film, just not a great one. watch our movie review show movie talk at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vocozrlvfmza",positive

"im certain if you read the screenplay for this third entry in the jaws franchise youd think it could amount to a solid sequel. theres nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it at least adds many new elements to the jaws formula. where it all goes wrong is in the execution. the acting, direction, and production values are way, way below what they should have been. the 3d effects are ridiculous. they bring to mind a sctv parody of 3d films, with exaggerated tricks that add nothing to someone watching this in regular format. compare this to something like the creature from the black lagoon, or it came from outer space those films were 3d but play perfectly well as flat films. but those were made by people with talent, this film is not. theres also the weird idea of using the sea world park, but making it a fictitious one located near the ocean with completely different attractions its a strange bit of promotional advertising. the real sea world is quite different, and yet its shown with all these fantastic elements that are pure fantasy. a better idea would have been to name the marine attraction something original. the scenes somehow come off way more corny and trite than the actual theme park was at the time. the use of the dolphins is a great idea that is staged horribly. the old flipper show had better shark vs. dolphin scenes. the effects are wretched. in fact, had they worked it would have helped save the whole film from being a waste, but they are totally amateurish, below that of a roger corman exploitation film from the 50s or 60s. one expects more from a major studio mounting a sequel to a megahit. the actors offer nothing here. dennis quaid and louis gosset have shown remarkable talent, but none of it is on display here. bess armstrong and lea thompson are both very attractive, but again they dont really add anything, and thompson seems especially vapid here. luckily all these actors are in a film so filled with incompetence that the music, effects, editing and overall storytelling distract from their work.",negative

"very good comedy. i rate this movie based on fact that it was meant to entertain and hype me it did its job well. and when i mean hype i mean i had very low expectations, and it really met them. this film is pure gold, it has all these black people culture jokes, penis jokes, toiler jokes, sex jokes, all the love you need. the whole movie makes you wonder, what else unexpected turn of events will happen, what does the director of this masterpiece throw at us in the next scene, you are basically tense throughout whole movie. so if you want to have fun by making fun of quality black humor this film is the best for it. i rate it 9 out of 10.",negative
"uwe boll is known for two things. making terrible adaptations of video games and challenging his critics to a boxing match and beating them up. hes also really successful at both of those of those things meaning hes continued to make these movies and threatening to beat up his critics whenever they give him a bad review. the story is a group of friends go to an island for a rave but when they get there the place is deserted. they happen upon a creepy old house, theres zombies, they fight and most of them die in the process. thats pretty much it. the acting is bad. the overall look of the movie is bad. the entire process is just flawed from start to finish. and if youve ever played the game its based on you will ask yourself wtf was that? because its nothing like the game. and the worst part of it is theres a funny version of this movie. most of it was made up with outtakes or giving the actors free reign to act funny. and then when that didnt work, they just added fart noises whenever you saw somebodys butt. are you laughing yet? uwe boll seems to think thats funny. honestly, theres nothing worth watching here.",negative

"well, just the fact that i am writing this review says a lot about this movie. i have been going to movies religiously for as long as i can remember, and i have always seen films that i have considered greatness, i.e. fargo, saving private ryan. but this film reached a new plateau within my film criticism rankings. i am currently studying film in college, and i cant describe to you how this film has changed the way i will forever judge my own work in the future. this film has some sort of raw human touch, but much different from other human touch films, i didnt realize i was becoming emotionally involved with the characters. it just sort of got inside me like a virus and subconsciously helped me enjoy the movie. the only negative criticism ive read about this cinematic masterpiece is that from people who are angered by the fact that it looks lightly on the holocaust. it seems that these critics are upset because it doesnt show true justice on how the nazis tortured the jews. all i have to say to those critics is hey, everyone knows the nazis treated the jews like animals, we dont need another movie to remind us! if i had survived the holocaust i would much rather see this movie than one that would bring all the horrible memories back. also...if your thinking about not seeing this movie because of the subtitles dont worry. this is my first subtitled film and everyone told me before i went in that i wouldnt notice them after awhile. and i was like yeah right, this is going to suck having to look at the bottom of the screen the whole time. but its true!! i was bothered the first 5 minutes or so because im a slow reader and i was having trouble keeping up. but i soon got with the pace. as i was driving home from the theater i thought to myself hey, that movie had subtitles. well, as this is my first review of a film ever, i hope it wasnt too bad for everyone to read. .....anyway, go see la vita bella !!!!!!!!",positive

"ah, the bearthe show that makes you question your life choices while simultaneously making you crave a beefy italian sub. who knew a series about a chaotic kitchen could turn my leisurely bingewatching into a highstakes culinary thrill ride? lets start with the main dish jeremy allen white as carmy. watching him juggle familial trauma, a failing restaurant, and a kitchen full of colorful read certifiably insane characters feels like a masterclass in stress management. its like someone took the anxiety of hells kitchen and injected it with a heaping dose of heart and humor. who knew a sprinkle of dysfunction could taste so good? the supporting cast deserves its own michelin star. ayo edebiri as sydney brings a fresh energy, and her witty banter with carmy is a delightful palate cleanser between the chaos. then theres the character of richieif there was an award for most relatable disaster, hed win it hands down. hes the embodiment of that friend who constantly shows up to your house uninvited but somehow makes every situation funnier. the cinematography? simply delicious. the camera work pulls you right into the bustling chaos of the kitchen, making you feel like youre dodging pots and pans along with the cast. just when i thought i couldnt handle the heat, the show turns the burner down for some genuinely touching moments. i mean, who knew that a kitchen could be the backdrop for existential crises? however, not everything is perfectly seasoned. at times, the plot meanders like a lost waiter at a crowded restaurant. there are moments where you might feel like youve been served a dish thats all sizzle and no steak. but hey, isnt that just like real life? you take the good with the slightly overcooked. in conclusion, the bear serves up a rich blend of humor, heart, and some serious food for thought. just remember if you cant handle the kitchen, stay out of the dining room. or, you know, just make reservations somewhere else. bon apptit!",positive

"it certainly is all over town. aamirs next has been hyped immensely and its not surprising if you are not able to find a movie ticket this weekend. but at the end it all boils down to the question is the movie worth all the hype ?? after watching it, i can say that the answer quite disappointingly is no. two college friends farhan qureshi r. madhavan and raju rastogi sharman joshi embark on a journey to find the third friend idiot rancho aamir khan who mysteriously disappeared after college five years ago. the films story is told through flashbacks as the characters journey to shimla in search of rancho the person who managed to change their outlook towards life. the problem with 3 idiots according to me is that although it tackles a very complex issue, it chooses to do so in a lighthearted way which essentially converts this movie into a comedy something present in abundance in btown. no doubt the humor is topnotch and keeps you rolling in laughter but the movie simple fails to connect you emotionally with the characters as opposed to, for example, taare zameen par 2007 which i feel, after watching this, is far more superior in terms of characterization and emotional depth. by the time it reaches the climax, you can well anticipate almost everything that would happen. as for the performances, they are topnotch. undeniably, aamir is one of the finest and this movie reaffirms this. however, what most people seem to be forgetting is that there are two more actors in this movie who, given the opportunity, are as capable as aamir themselves. first r. madhavan as farhan qureshi is simply brilliant. watch the scene wherein he tries to explain his point of view to his parents. next, sharman joshi as raju rastogi really shines not just in the comic sequences but in the more serious ones which the movie has very few. revealing the sequence in which he shines may act as a potential spoiler but watch out for a scene in the principals office in which the principal asks him to type a rustication letter. kareena kapoor is really a thorn in this movie and her romance with aamir is something that should have been either toned down or chopped off. omi as the ideal geek is impressive more so than kareena. the cinematography is good and breathtaking in the opening song where the lush greenery of shimla is captured with such finesse that it induces a sense of wonder. the music is good but the songs have not been used that effectively. for instance, give me some sunshine not only has weak choreography, but it comes at a moment which severely reduces its impact. the promo featuring that song was far superior in fact that was what fooled me into believing that this movie could end up as a masterful lesson in life. some of the sequences could have been trimmed down. on the whole, although 3 idiots is a good movie, it is hard to understand people calling a masterpiece or a breakthrough in cinema. movies like taare zameen par 2007 or even hiranis own lage raho munnabhai 2006 are better movies as compared to this. nevertheless, the movie does provide some really good entertainment so if youre looking forward to just relax and chill out, go for this. for those however seeking some serious depth and a perspective in the life of an engineer, id say the movie tries and succeeds in parts but an engineers life and the pressures she faces are a different game altogether. although the movie it enjoyable, it is far from authentic. and this comes from an engineer although an idiotic one. now i may get a lot of sore thumbs down on this one but this in my opinion on this movie written in all earnestness. dont enter this movie with high expectations and you may perhaps find that all izz indeed well !!! score 7.010.0 !!",positive

"its funny to me how so many people will review a movie without taking the movies target demographic into consideration. son of the mask is a movie thats meant to be enjoyed by families with children and young adults. i watched this film with my three boys all of which are under ten years of age. my boys laughed nonstop throughout the entire film and thoroughly enjoyed it. they could care less if it had too many cgi effects or if some of the jokes were juvenile in nature. this movie gave them exactly what they look for in a comedy. it is a fun film with loads of slapstick comedy, crazy antics, and lots of physical humor. jamie kennedy did a great job appealing to what the younger viewers want to see such as, over the top acting, exaggerated facial expressions, and an overall zany performance. if you take the movie for what it is, which is a silly comedy that provides cheap laughs and a fun atmosphere, than it is a total success. i would recommend this movie to anyone with young kids that is looking for a fun film to watch with the family.",negative

"if i was just reviewing the first season i would have given this a 9. it could be a bit corny at times but season one but for the most part it was a funny and well written show. despite being about a football team the fictional afc richmond only a two footballers amongst the main cast, these being roy kent brett goldstein and jamie tartt phil dunster with the main focus being on the off field characters. personally i think this was a good decision as a small cast of characters allowed each character room to grow. sadly this started to be undone in season 2. there is a notable decline in the quality of the writing and with the episode run time being expanded from 30 minutes to between 4550 minutes and with it came a lot of padding. this results in the rest of the richmond squad getting a lot more screentime as a result but they are such poorly developed set of characters that they are little more than caricatures. if one or two were brought into the main cast then it might of worked but bringing in most of the first eleven was a mistake, especially as most are not particularly good actors. some of the story lines also started getting a bit soapy as well as the focus moved away from being about ted lasso and his struggles at afc richmond to the private lives of the characters. there are some funny moments but overall there is a big decline in quality from the first season. sadly season 3 is a mess and i found it virtually unwatchable. episodes get bloated even more with several running over an hour. the result is numerous poorly written story lines that dont go anywhere. we see sams restaurant get trashed after his criticism of the home secretary clearly inspired by suella braverman but this storyline is swiftly forgotten about. we also see colins struggle with dealing with his homosexuality, a story that could have been quite powerful if written properly given that there is just one openly gay professional footballer in england. but no, this episode storyline is often forgotten about for much of the season resulting it feeling more as filler than anything. with season 3 i also couldnt help but feel that the joke of ted not knowing anything about football had worn very thing at this point given that hes been at the club two years. the only positive i can really say about season 3 is the episode sunflowers which is well worth the watch and has writing on a par with the first season. the scenes with roy and jamie are particularly excellent. my advice would be to watch season 1 and call it quits there. there are some great performances from jason sudeikis, juno temple, brett goldstein and phil dunster but that cant mask the big drop in quality of the writing from the second season.",negative
"today, i went to the theatre to experience kiran raos new movie, laapataa ladies. i was stunned when i watched the movie. the performances, storytelling, humor, and social messages were outstanding. initially, i wasnt very interested in seeing her new movie, considering kiran rao had directed only one movie in her career, dhobi ghat. however, knowing that she is aamir khans exwife and has been a codirector, writer, and producer of many good films, i decided to give it a try. lets talk about the movie. the cast is entirely new actors and actresses are all new faces to me. but they gave their best in the movie, especially pratibha ranta and ravi kishan. the social message part of the movie was really good, highlighting how women were treated like servants or slaves. they showed various issues, including agricultural problems, that exist in india. the movie is set in the 20s era when mobile phones were just introduced in india, and the only game was the snake game on nokia mobiles, so there was no internet, no gen z, and no adult scenes. it was a purely cinematic experience. the girl who stole my heart is nitanshi goel. she is so cute, man. i loved her. she is now added to my crush list. anyway, you should watch this movie if you want to see some good wholesome social drama. this movie will absolutely win your heart. i give this movie 4.55. lastly, i want to share something that happened in the theatre. a guy who was working at inox, where i watched the movie, asked me, sir, boi ta kemon laaglo ar etake apni koto star deben out of 5. i told him the same rating that i gave in this review.",positive

"this movie was better than scary movie 1 scary movie 2 scary movie 3 . think about how many bad movies youve seen. this new korean film director is from korea, and this country never made sf movies before. everybody said he will make horrible movie because those who were cowards so called themselves korean movie director were too afraid of the bad comments and they only blamed for lack of materials, supports and techniques. i bet only few of his own country people helped him and supported him. its a shame. however, this director is brave enough to try with his best effort to make the first korean sf movie in the american film industry. we all should give him a credit because he deserves to have one. he surely needs to make more improvement on his next movies, but for the first starter, this movie did not waste my time or money. like i said earlier, this movie was better than some of movies i have seen before.",positive
"after making the woefully regrettable decision to pay money to see epic movie, i had vowed to stay far away from this movie and any other with the word movie in the title. but, because i am faint of heart andor an idiot, i allowed myself to be talked into watching a leaked version online because a it was actually pretty funny, according to friends who had seen it already, b it was only about 70 minutes long, and c this edward was actually hot. after watching it for myself, i would agree on all three counts especially c .daaaaamn. its no great cinematic achievement, but for a devoted twilight hater such as myself, it was worth a chuckle or two. sure, vampires suck meets many of the same pitfalls other parody movies do. it operates under the delusion that anyone out of diapers thinks that a character being bludgeoned over the head time and time again for absolutely no reason is comedy gold. it often relies on stupid pop culture jokes look! a jersey shore reference! its funny because it is a jersey shore reference! and unoriginal grossout humor its funny because you want to vomit! haha!. but, so help me if i didnt find myself laughing at the way the film mercilessly mocks everything laughable about the twilight movies, a series that, lets face it, lends itself pretty easily to parody. in fact, all vampires suck really had to do was recreate the first two twilight films pretty much sceneforscene, tweaking here and there to make the scenes only slightly more ridiculous than the originals. the result is actually a pretty clever sendup of the ludicrously overthetop melodrama that twilight lovers eat up. this film holds a mirror up to pretty much everything laughable about the series that proves that a wildly successful bookmovie franchise does not necessarily need a plot the rabidity of its fan base the shameless parade of shirtless males the idea that teenage stephanie meyer er, i mean, bella, would be the object of every hot guys lust despite being a mopy sourpuss with no trace of a personality the insistence that robert pattinson is sexy. the actress who plays bella, or becca, as she is renamed, does a killer job parodying kristen stewarts mannerisms hairtucking, downward gazes, constant lowerlip biting by which i mean she mimics them exactly and everyone laughs at them because they are stupid. mocking twilight is not exactly hard to do, but i have to say this film does it quite cleverly at many points. ill even say that the ending is magnificent. needless to say, vampires suck is for members of team i want a boy who doesnt want to kill me only, as im sure twilight fans would not appreciate being forced to acknowledge that the thing they love is dumber than a sack of fruit fly larvae. however, since like i said the movie is pretty much just a recreation of the original twilight movies, many of the jokes are best appreciated having actually seen them. so youll probably like this movie if you are not a twilight fan, but have actually seen the movies because a you were dragged there by a girl whose pants you really, really wanted to get into, b you were stoned, walked into the wrong theater, and failed to realize that it wasnt the hangover until it was too late, or c you are selfloathing and willingly subjected yourself to them out of morbid curiosity like me. so if you hate twilight and everything it stands for, take a break from your violent yet strangely erotic fantasies about robert pattinson and taylor lautner and go see vampires suck. it will ease your tortured soul, and maybe, just maybe, restore a molecule of faith in the parody genre. it couldnt possibly be worse than meet the spartans.",negative

"i want to strike a blow for a movie that seems to be one of the worst movies, when you follow the ratings and verdicts here. but its easy here to rate one star without watching a movie, and also without giving one thought to. of course it isnt an artwork, a masterwork, or comparable to high budget productions a la lord of the rings. instead, it fits right into a solid line of straighttovideo productions, or some bigger tv adventure movies, but is definitively enjoyable for people who dont expect a lifetime experience from uwe boll. but at least, one have to respect the genre outside the tolkien realm. if not, the movie has no chance at all. it is a simple story about a girl that wants revenge for the killing of her mother by her father, who is the most powerful vampire, and also wants to be ruler of the world. kristanna loken as rayne does a good job being sexy, powerful and filled with hate and blood hunger. the others are ok, and ben kingsley does keep a low profile, because he has not very much to do except being old ben kingsley. directing is not great, i admit that, it is at max, zealous. definitevly it is better than in any of the infamous asylum movies ive seen, in terms of storytelling, actors leading and so on. the only one bigger mistake is that the short history of raynes romance with sebastian is revealed at the end of the movie, so that the short sex scene with him looks quite unfounded. if there wouldnt be so much blood and gore, it could pass as a movie for youngsters. i remember watching such movies of course without gore and without nudity, when i was ten or twelve.",negative
"this movie still stands as a rock today, over half a century after its release. as movies from the 40s and 50s seem to be a bit slow compared to todays standards for example in movement and conversation this is certainly not the case in singin in the rain. maybe the sound of music is a winner when it comes down to remarkable and memorable tunes, but this movie also has a few pretty tricks on its sleeve. first of all there is the fabulous and superb choreography and tap dancing, one of the most impressive achievements in movie history. secondly this movie is a homage to movies and actors, in their struggles to make the movie a mature form of art. and last but not least, there is humor all over the place. especially the ups and downs of making and releasing the first talkie musical is extremely funny. singin in the rain is therefore a milestone in the evolution of movie making and deserves to be watched by everyone who likes dance and musical.",positive

jesse eisenberg has dropped a film that is only his second directorial venture which he has written and acted as well. i personally liked this movie that is equally emotional hilarious within a perfect runtime. a real pain is plain and simple yet so deep and engaging that you wont realize how fast the 90 mins have passed. starring jesse himself and keiran culkin as two cousin who plan a trip to poland in order to honor their late grandmas wish who was a survivor of terrible holocaust. they join a travel group of four other members and a tour guide which are the only other cast in this picture. isnt this amazing. culkin has given a standout performance of a troubled guy with a sparkling personality which is in contrast with jesses character whos a family man with social anxiety disorder. this personality mismatch adds a hysterical touch to this emotional tour. they have this difference of opinion on everything yet they adore one another which is so heartening at times. background score is in a perfect sync with the storyline that makes this a smooth sail. a must watch in every sense.,positive
"i think its safe to say that video game block busters are no longer a mere fantasy. with franchises like mario and sonic finding financial success in recent years, it makes me happy that hollywood is starting to see the value in competent and intelligent video game movies. its been a bumpy round to say the least. after i saw the first trailer, i was predicting that the industry was about to devolve back into the dark ages. where luigi was marios adopted son and kevin james was president of the united states. but to my surprise, the movie was actually quite entertaining. and while it wasnt the groundbreaking, authentic minecraft film that fans were hoping to see someday, id argue its the adventure, comedy film we needed to see today. with the news being so depressing lately, seeing jack black play a hilarious minecraft action hero is just what the doctor ordered. not every joke is a winner, but i really think he makes this movie work. his reactions, his delivery, it makes the weakest jokes ten times funnier. it may be a basic isekai story, with human characters trying to survive and save an enchanted realm. but half the time it feels like a roller coaster ride, with the crew jumping from one place to the next. i loved watching these types of films as a kid and after having to deal with such an annoying week of college group projects, this is just what i needed. its not a great film, but its a good film. i find most of the human characters pretty forgettable, aside from steve and garrett, who have hilarious bromance throughout the whole film. which gets even funnier with the gay innuendo jokes. i dont how well this film will age. someday when i grow old we might finally get those authentic video game films that completely change the industry. similar to how the mcu and the dark knight impacted comic books films. but at the moment, i think is a good start. give it time and the seeds these filmmakers plant will start to bloom. will stop trying to recreate magic for a moment and instead try to create new magic.",positive

"this movie is so bad that the only thing good about it is that you can use it as a frisbee! nothing like the first one, the actors are terrible and resemble something totally different from the first and everything about the movie was bad. who made this movie 10 year olds? the plot is all over the place once harry and lloyd are doing something one minute and another minute they are doing something totally different. and when i was watching the movie i did not conceive what the conflict was about throughout the whole film! this whole movie was a total waste of electricity watching it! once you have made a very funny and original movie, dont make another one.",negative
"just because they made a movie about the spice girls doesnt mean it will automatically be good. in fact, this movie is so bad i couldnt even find stuff to make fun of. its also living proof that the filmmakers could have released anything, no matter how bad, and spice girls fans still would have turned out on droves to see it. which is exactly what the filmmakers did. kind of scary, really.",negative

this is so far the best content i have seen on the screen. each and every episode is special on its space. every emotions captured beautifully. and litterally makes you cry. a nostalgic ride for the every 90s kid. the character portrait by each and every actor is amazing. how the little emotions between the characters are captured is a treat to watch. music score is excellent and matches the notes with the amazing content. you definitely feel a connection with each and every portion of the series. salute to the entire cast and crew. on the camera as well as off the camera.,positive

"everyone decided the bennifer romance was cheesy, and from then on they could do no right. so gigli became cool to trash. the film had some nice points. the revisionist gangster theme was welcome for once these tough guys are not proving their mettle in pointless violent scenes. jo lo enters the story calmly telling us she can kick bens butt, but gladly the story did not provide us with any cheesy fight scenes. people say that ben was unconvincing as a thug well wake up, that was the point! he has a feminine side that jo lo sees, and likes him for. it is never explicit as his character would never have admitted to it openly, but it is fielded between them. the jo lo character has real character, and handles all the men in the story with grace and ease she is always calm and keeps a wry smile as the various men in the story posture and say how tough they are. she can see right through the bravado, and handles each conflict differently, but always with the ease and capability of someone of secure character. she does not end up as a converted lesbian as many reviews portray, and unlike chasing amy. she has been with men before and does not change here. the theme is the teasing out the feminine side of the not really so tough guy affleck. now, american audiences seem to miss subtlety many british sitcoms and movies are rewritten for america making the humour and sub plots more on the nose because they are missed entirely in the states. so yes, affleck is not convincing as a thug he is not supposed to be. jo lo is actually bisexual as the film clearly tells us, rather than lesbian as she claims. look more carefully. she is also the most mature character, and very capable she is more the man than any of the other characters which is why she prefers female lovers. the rest of the story is by the by so dont expect development of exciting plots as this is about people. various characters come and go as we are seeing a slice of life rather than a rounded disney story. for some reason everyone expects al pacino or the other characters to keep coming back. well life does not provide nice little events with a beginning, middle and endwithcharacterdevelopment. life is a series of scenes that are disjointed, and without resolution or closure. the character is the crucial element and afflecks is carefully and implicitly aired between the lines. not every film should bang its black and white dialog right on the nose.",negative
"the emoji movie is a new childrens film. one of the posters for it has a picture of whipped poop on the front of it. was there a focus group done that says kids really want this? this masterpiece takes place inside of some kids iphone in a place called textopolis. gene is a meh emoji who just wants to cut loose and show a whole range of emotions, which apparently counts as a malfunction and gets him scheduled for deletion. now before you think im just going to crap on this movie, know that it is kind of fun for a certain age. these killer robots chase gene and two of his buddies around which always keeps things fastpaced, theres all sorts of promotional tieins with candy crush, instagram, and spotify that while cheap product placement, also are kinda funny and exciting. like all kids movies nowadays with fairly weak scripts, theres also a soundtrack filled with dance songs that should have kids dancing in the aisles, and guess what, its not just stuff from your kids generation but some from yours too. take the stuff thats for you where you can cause a lot of the jokes are either literal bores internet trolls are trolls, etc. or center a lot on cartoons having overly cartoony personalities. theres an overly smiley emoji who borders on the psychotic, joyless meh emojis. this stuff is kinda funny, but the joke is thin. then theres the stuff you should expect already going in. like the jokes centered on the poop emoji, or the hifive emoji saying talk to the hand. does anyone say this anymore? its amazing this movie was cowritten by mike white, writer of school of rock and jennifer anistons the good girl. its sporadically funny and you can tell its trying be a kind of wreck itralph meets inside out but its not really inventive enough to be either. the kid whose phone this is never really becomes much of a character and probably the funniest part of this movie is that among a plethora of other scattered and unsubtle messages about including everyone and real friends are better than online ones, this also comes with a message of be yourself told primarily through emojis who want to be more than themselves. lastly, and for the love of god i hope this was meant as a joke, there are scenes where the emoji is given way too much credit in the scope of love and life in this film. if this is true then it really does go all the way down from here folks. but thats the emoji movie in a nutshell. youll laugh in parts, wanna reach over and tell your kids movies used to be so much better than this in others, and finally, just want to weep for the future. if you liked this, please check out craig james review on youtube for more.",negative

you have a great chance to do something with these characters. waterfield does nothing with that. you can put random masks on wrong turn like killers and call it whatever you want. if your gonna call it winnie the pooh at least have pooh be pooh. not some dude in a pooh mask. plus no tigger or any other characters. its just random weirdness. sure its gory but that doesnt make it good. it takes itself way too seriously. this could have been great. could have been epic even. this is just nasty bile. so go rewatch the wrong turn series to see what winnie the pooh is trying to be apparently. at least then youll get some laughs.,negative

"the sting. the sting 1973 is one of everybodys favorite films. director george roy hill took a page from his successful western, butch cassidy and the sundance kid, and teamed paul newman and robert redford once again, this time for an academy award four star movie about con men. the intricate saga of the sting is set in 1936 chicago. it tells the story of grifters, henry gondorff and johnny hooker, played by paul newman and robert redford, respectively. they con the bad guy, doyle lonnegan, played by robert shaw. and at every turn, they con the audience as well. the poker game is five card draw straight poker in the film and is set on a train traveling from new york to chicago. newman and redford are on the train along with shaw. the game has been set up by shaw with the cooperation of the conductor. we dont know how newman and redford know exactly what day and what train shaw is taking from new york to chicago, but that is beside the purpose of our discussion. shaw is a known card cheater, but newman will prove to be a better one. once again the holy game of poker will be sullied by the movies. this time, well love every minute of it. newman arranges to get himself invited to the poker game, through the conductor. he arrives sober, but apparently inebriated. it is the perfect act, consummately played in a boozy, needling performance by paul newman. shaws character is a known cold decker a cold deck is a deck introduced surreptitiously into the game with hands prearranged to break one of the players and newman will have to play over the top of the cold deck when it is placed into the game. one of the subtleties of the event is missed by most viewers. newman must ready himself to overcome the cold deck. during the play of hands, we see newman hold the cards close to his vest and, at least once, his cards disappear briefly below table level, out of sight, and back again. newman knows shaw cold decks middle cards against low cards, and so newman is gathering and holding out jacks. newman immediately insults shaw upon arrival and continues to heckle him throughout the play of the game, thus making sure shaw will cold deck the game to teach the upstart drunk a lesson. when shaw goes to the mens room to arrange to fix the cold deck, newman knows the time has come. in real life, cold decks were nearly always arranged in mens rooms. they should have had a dedicated stall marked coolers made here. the game is three handed at this point. shaw will bring the cold deck in when he cuts the cards for the dealer to his left. in filming the cold decking, the camera shows a pair of hands over the deck, then theres a cut in the continuity. then the camera goes immediately back to the deck and we see the hands with the warm deck going to a handkerchief in shaws lap, leaving the cold deck on the table. i guess it would have been hard to do in one long shot. the detail is interesting during the dealing of the cold deck. newman is fussing with his cigar and poking behind his vest, implying something is happening. but we never see newman with hand positions that could be holding out cards. newman is dealt trip threes and shaw is dealt a pair of nines. the third player is the dealer and he is out of the hand. newman draws two cards and gets his four threes with the six of hearts. shaw draws three cards and gets his four nines with the ten of spades. the planning of the arranged cold deck is well done and probable. after the cards are dealt, the cards on top of the deck are, in order, a three, the six of hearts, two nines and the ten of spades. it doesnt matter whether newman draws one or two cards, hell make his four threes and, in either case, shaw, in drawing three cards, will make his four nines. now, heres the unlikely trick. newman must change the hand with four threes for a hand with four jacks. it would be easiest to hold out an entire hand of four jacks and a fifth card and switch five card hands. but newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks hes held out and he keeps the six of hearts. that is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. newman also takes the chance that shaw wont have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines, but in having to play over the top of the cold deck, that gamble is unavoidable. shaws problem is that he cant call newman for card manipulation because shaw has an audience, the other players and the conductor. after newman leaves the cabin, shaw says to his lackey, what was i supposed to do? call him for cheating better than me, in front of the others? shaw was able to get 10,000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. but that was okay with newman. the film shows shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand, implying he has disposed of the warm deck. however, we never see newman clean up. so, when he leaves the poker cabin, one deck is short four jacks, the other deck has four extra jacks, and newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. whoever the conductor gives the decks to next, will have a few surprises. despite its faults, the poker scene from the sting is the most fun filled, greatest directed, best acted, and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. and it was made over thirty years ago. silver dollar sam nothingwild.com",positive

"move over, meryl streep and dame judy densch...the next wave of young thespian geniuses is storming the screen, and the path is being blazed by stunning mariah carey. given nothing but a bareboned outline of a plot to work with, ms. carey explodes across the screen with a depth and complexity of character unseen since vivian leighs multifaceted scarlet ohara in gone with the wind back in 1939. every colour of the rainbow, and some even out of the range of the known colour scheme, are clearly and sharply delineated by mariah in every frame of this masterpiece every subtle shade and nuance of billie frank is drawn with precision sharpness and crystal clarity. it is said that the ultimate sign of true artistry in film is when one can look at any single frame of a motion picture and instantly know what is going on just from the facial expressions and body language of the actors within. glitter certainly exemplifies this theory. at any given moment, one can look at mariahs billie frank and instantly see every idiosyncrasy of the woman inside. the relationships she has with, and her feelings towards, every character she interacts with in the film is beautifully fleshedout and drawn with a broad brush. each and every word mariah speaks in glitter was meticulously delivered by her, and obviously carefully studied during perusal of the script. mariah delivers infinitely more than the onedimensional billie other reviews have led us to expect. her transitions from despondency, to loneliness, to anger, to triumph...all brought forth with a crispness and clarity unknown to this age of the cinematic experience. and the ease with which she presents all these ranges of emotion draws you into the character of billie, to the point where you hang breathlessly on mariahs next word. she has such a natural talent, such an incredible comfort in front of the camera, that you instantly forget you are watching an actress playing billie you believe she really is billie. this can only be the smallest taste of what is to come from this future screen legend. mariah has made her mark on the film industry, and now can, and must, move on to deeper, more complex roles...she must rightfully stake her claim as one of the greatest screen presences in cinema history. how marvelous it would be to see her take on some of the great female characters of literary classics, so in vogue today. a jane eyre, for example, or lizzy in pride and prejudice. many of shakespeares greatest works have remained uncommitted to celluloid what greater compliment to the works of the master himself than to have them graced by mariah carey? please, do yourself a favour you must see this movie, and see it with an open mind. those who scoff are simply those who had already decided that mariah would be a failure in the crossover from music to film. they cannot admit they were wrong for, unlike barbra streisand and madonna before her, embarrassments both, mariah carey is a fabulous, fantastic, brilliant actress. again, look at everything she was able to do with this meagre script!!! mariah carey is the most stunningly beautiful, breathtaking, sexy, sensuous, heartstopping woman ever to appear on the stage or screen. so many times during this movie, i realized that i was so captivated by her beauty that i wasnt even breathing my heart was pounding so fiercely at the sight of her, i though it would burst. believe me, mariah...keep acting...keep singing...you will always be remembered as a priceless legend.",negative

"perhaps the best part of this movie was the beginning, but after that, it was really more like a long kids cartoon. sorry i know lots of people including critics love this film, but im just calling it as i saw it. there were no earthshattering scenes that im replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that i will quote one day, nor mindblowing visuals that i will tantalizingly dwell on. for me, it was just a good movie, nothing more. a lot of this movie is like walle. theres a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. if you like that sort thing, great! the actionoriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great. a real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. a mysterious exotic creature or something would have been far engaging. instead, we get an ungainly, multicolored bird thats kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoapuffs cereal bird. 3d this movie was pretty tame in its use of 3d. its there, but after 10 minutes, ill it kind of fades to the background. just a day later, i remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3d one. soooo ... what do i recommend? i recommend seeing it! even though i give it a 610, i know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average moviegoer will like it is high. what i would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it. think about best movies you have ever seen remember them clearly, and then ask ... was this one of them ... really?",positive

"this movie came out so late here in norway! jesus! anyway, scary movie v is the latest installment in the scary movie franchise. in this one, most of the cast from the previous movies are absent. thats not a good sign. in this one, we get parodies of more recent movies, like paranormal activity, mama, rise of the planet of the apes and ... the shawshank redemption? oh well, only two of those are horror movies, but oh well... im gonna cut right to the chase. this movie is not horrible. if you thought the previous ones were funny, youre gonna think this one is funny. in fact, i find scary movie v to be one of the funnier movies in the series. that may be because ive seen most of the movies parodied in this one, as opposed to the other ones where theres only a couple parodies per movie i actually get. anyways, back to the point everyone seems to hate this movie, and i say what do you except? do you really want a clever comedy with smart humor and jokes that you are gonna remember your whole life? no. the scary movies are stupid. some of the stupidest movies ever, but that doesnt matter, because they know it. they dont try to make it good, theyre just making another scary movie. i think a lot of people have forgotten to have mindless fun with comedies. everyone expects a comedy to be memorable these days. yes, this movies not the most fun youll have in the theater, but it is a fun movie to watch with friends nonetheless. again, if you like the other scary movies, theres no reason not to watch this one its pretty much a modern take on the same formula thats been going on for 13 years now. its good for what it is.",negative
"that seems to be the general consensus regarding rick and morty and this reviewer cannot disagree. am a huge fan of animation, something that most people on here will most likely know about already have made no secret of it and appreciate all kinds of humour. am not always the biggest fan of the cruder, grossout style of humour and have seen it done badly more times than can be counted, but when its done well it is funny. had heard nothing but great things of the show and finally decided to make my way through it quickly. on the most part, rick and morty is well worth watching and there is a huge amount to like and enjoy. at the same time, part of me did feel that it didnt quite live up to the acclaimed hype. seasons 13 deserve any ounce of the praise they get, as they make for some of the best animated television in recent years. do have to agree completely with those saying that seasons 4 and 5 dont feel the same, which is why my mostly positive opinion isnt here. beginning with the good, seasons 13 are brilliantly written. namely the genuinely hilarious and clever humour that gets away with a lot, where even the cruder parts dont come over as too distasteful, timed impeccably. which is balanced beautifully with poignant emotional elements, without falling into over sentimentality. the concept is a creative one and is done justice by the imaginative and wonderfully energetic storytelling, admittedly the atmosphere is bizarre and can be random but that was part of the charm as someone who is used to this kind of storytelling it wasnt an issue at all. characters have very individual and entertaining personalities, while the voice acting from all is spot on something that didnt change when the show declined. the music is dynamic with the action and the theme song is infectious. have seen criticisms of the animation, but while the character designs take some getting used to it is very richly detailed and vibrant. really do wish that seasons 4 and 5 were better than they were, but they were really disappointing. where there is a lot of predictability and fatigued rehashing and the energy is noticeably slower and not near as lively. there is very little that is imaginative and it was like the creative concept had run its course. furthermore, the writing is nowhere near as strong, with the humour, or more like the attempts at it which is a lot fewer in quantity, being far too safe and careful rather than the bold risk taking that seasons 13 had. it also gets really juvenile and the stupidity goes through the roof. even the characters lose their spark, with rick becoming dumbed down and annoying, as well as their chemistry. in summary, loved it to begin with and it had all the makings of a classic but it is a shame that it declined so significantly. 710.",positive

"michael brody is all grown up and is now a park worker at floridas sea world with his marine biologist girlfriend kathryn. the new manmade lagoon with its maze of underwater tunnels called the undersea kingdom is shortly to open, but before doing so a great white shark is caught in the lagoon and with some convincing owner calvin bouchard sees it as an opportunity to generate some business for the park. so on the opening day a dead body of a missing worker is found, but kathryn realises that it wasnt their great white which killed the man. it was its mother who is approximately 35foot long and is living unknowingly in the lagoon. wow, what crap! yeah its bad, but despite the negative flack that this film always seems to cop at least its watchable trite. for me this is one big guilty pleasure and its actually my favourite jaws sequel oh my! i think it was the last one i saw in the series and jaws the revenge being the first ugh! well, the sequels are simply stinkers with the franchise turning into somewhat of a joke thankyou jaws the revenge. but i thoroughly enjoyed this scratchy and quite corny flick. actually, the concept for the film isnt too bad, but its just the execution where it goes awry and the script is a bit of a groaner too. well really, the rotten to the core special effects is what sticks out like a sore thumb, though it made it even more amusing in its ineptness. thats because originally the film was released in 3d, but since the images are in 2d is looks quite bad and flat. who knows the gimmick might have blown me away eh, probably not, but i still think that i would get a good laugh out of it. well it would add more to the factor since the film is simply an unintentional comedy yeah comedy, because there isnt too much in the way of thrills. it was just too goofy to be effective with only one or two suspenseful spurts that will raise a sweat, but more so its plain cringeworthy and simply implausible. the useless screenplay is pretty thin and dramatically flat across the board, but i give them points for a change of scenery. the films setting is perfect and its a real change of pace. i dont know if you can actually call it jaws show, since it basically took every opportunity to promote floridas sea world, even if there was a shark on the loose eating guests. but it centres more about the park and disaster this whole mayhem plays on it, which in doing so makes us want more bang for our buck. the hysteria and shark attack scenes are reasonably quick flashes and just lacking the killer blow. but i didnt find it too much of a problem. but good gawd the shark looked terrifyingly horrid! seeing a shark close up would be petrifying, but here thats not the case because this rubber, robotic claptrap was totally unconvincing and incredibly overdone. we just see too much of it and i never knew sharks growl. oh well, if you cant scare the audience at least you got to amaze them in some shape. it also surprisingly builds up an atmosphere when the uninvited guests go munching and the underwater scenes are done quite well. the time goes by quick enough even with some irreverent padding. but for some people i can see why think its dull and thats because of the lack of horrific terror. the slowmotion sequences were horrifying, though! the music score is simply unspectacular with the trivial main theme making the only progress. the acting seems to be torn to shreds by people, but i thought dennis quaid, bess armstrong, louis gossett jr. and simon maccorkindale gave modest performances with weak characters. an entertaining bflick thats not that particularly exciting, but it tried to be different and i still i dont think its that dire as a lot people make it out to be. i dont know if it would make the film any better being in 3d, but the novelty of it would have been interesting.",negative
"ok, so whats the worst thing about mac and me? is it that the movie is a blatant e.t. ripoff? or is it that the movie is essentially a 90minute commercial complete with a dance sequence in a mcdonalds? whatever the answer is, the point is that this movie is the celluloid equivalent of a human rights abuse. it has no good qualities, not a single one it was incidental that this was jennifer anistons debut. i have seen a number of crummy movies that turned out to have sort of an enjoyable side. hell, i even took myra breckinridge and mommie dearest seriously no, really, i did. but mac and me is probably the movie that dr. forrester and tvs frank couldve shown mike, servo and crow to make them go insane on mystery science theater 3000. for the life of me i cannot figure out why steven spielberg didnt sue the makers of mac and me for copying e.t. then again, maybe its better that he didnt, since it wouldve given the ripoff undeserved publicity. it should come as no surprise that this litany of awfulness regularly shows up on lists of the worst movies ever made. it makes any ed wood movie look like a cross between citizen kane and dr. strangelove. thankfully, audiences recognized it for what it was and it bombed, and so there was no sequel.",positive

"during the first world war, a clumsy jewish soldier saves the life of career soldier schultz but in the process loses his memory. many years later he recovers and returns to his barber shop but the country of tomania has changed from what he would remember if he could remember it. the dictator adenoid hynkel has laid claim to the country and is mercilessly persecuting the jewish people. while hynkel continues his political persecutions which will next extend to brunettes, the unassuming barber finds himself in the midst of a form of resistance movement. although it is considered a classic, i had never actually seen this film. at the end of a week where i had not only seen little man but also norbit, i felt like perhaps my filmwatching choices were not the best i could be making and decided to come to this next. i dont normally like to step into context when watching a film because my enjoyment of it or not is based on a modern viewing, but with great dictator it is important to note that chaplin did not decide to do this film in the political climate that we now associate with hitler and the nazi party. at the time production started even britain was not at war with germany. so one does have to appreciate the career risks that chaplin was taking by mocking an european leader so far from america. of course time quickly showed his instincts to be correct and the film has lost none of its relevance. being his first all sound talky, i was impressed by how chaplin does so well with the comedy from the dialogue as well as the physical side. the film is very funny although it should be noted that those expecting the quickfire of gags associated with his best silent shorts will be a touch disappointed because it is more of a proper film with a plot and events rather than just setups for jokes. in regards the plotting, it is not always as effective as it could have been but this is understandable with the nature of the film. this is best seen in the concluding speech, which in regards plotting is not a great ending but in terms of using the film to make an impassioned plea to the world, it is hard to criticise. as an actor chaplin does surprisingly well as the barber, with a real sense of pain and longing in his turn. as hynkel, he is funnier but not as smart in the style of comedy. the supporting cast is mostly very good. i was very impressed by goddards performance but of course my favourite one was jack oakies wonderful napaloni. the great dictator is undoubtedly a film of significance in regards cinema history but this does not mean that it is not interesting and funny at the same time. the nature of it means that it is neither as strong a story nor as funny as one would hope but as a total package it is hard to fault. there are funnier chaplin films from earlier in his career but this is one definitely worth seeing.",positive
"tees maar khan is a film that, upon its release in 2010, might have seemed like an overthetop spectacle, but today, it stands as a cult classic that was truly ahead of its time. farah khans direction, combined with akshay kumars magnetic performance as the notorious conman, tabrez mirza khan, crafted an experience that resonates more deeply with todays audience. the films humor, vibrant songs, and audacious plot twists have aged like fine wine, and what once felt excessive now feels refreshingly bold. katrina kaifs iconic sheila ki jawani and akshaye khannas hilarious portrayal of the selfobsessed bollywood star, lord aatish kapoor, who dreams of winning an oscar, are performances that have only grown more endearing with time. the overthetop performances add a layer of hilarity that elevates the film, making every scene a laugh riot. the silliness of the jokes and the absurdity of the situations create a comedic goldmine that keeps delivering laughs no matter how many times you watch it. tees maar khan was misunderstood in its era but has since carved out a special place in the hearts of many, proving that sometimes, it takes a few years for a masterpiece to be truly appreciated. p. s. farah you are a genius, i genuinely live watching this movie atleast once every 6 months. please ask netflix to add it back to their library",negative

"what struck me first here was the overall lowbudget feel. a lot of things, such as the lighting and perhaps the editing, seem slightly amateurish, and if they tried making a standard hollywood blockbuster, they failed miserably. however, those who have seen and appreciated independent movies before will probably not be too appalled by this. the script is quite strange, but mainly this is actually a good thing. i thought the nonstandard humorous parts were funny and rather intelligent, particularly a scene with an extremely odd police officer, played by christopher walken. the quirky script makes the story progress very slowly, however, with the risk of boredom but the unpredictable nature of the film added a bit to the suspense. perhaps also aided by the decent soundtrack, i was able to connect with the characters. i thought the movie was fair enough. ben afflecks character is an awkward and pathetic type, and i guess this gives a risk that such a flawed movie itself will have an overall awkward feel. it does, but not to a gigantic and ridiculous degree. the acting is never superb, but really not astonishingly bad either. worse things happen at sea. the chemistry between affleck and lopez is very poor, but that sort of adds to the story. if youre looking for a turkey, this movie will probably disappoint you. ive seen far, far, far worse.",negative

"heres another movie where if youve seen the preview, youve pretty much seen the movie. all of the major plot twists are revealed and leave no surprises. the only thing not told is the ending, which is pretty predictable in itself. the opening scene tries to throw the viewer a curveball by showing jolie on a gurney, apparently dying. any intelligent viewer should know that she is not actually going to be killed off. angelina jolie tomb raider is charming in this film, but cannot hold it up completely. it might come off as uplifting and inspirational to a younger or more impressionable viewer, but just comes off as contrived and silly to anyone who can see through it. not to say that this movie is unwatchable. its actually kind of fun, just not very smart. there were plenty of laughs and the characters are interesting enough to keep you for the most part interested. edward burns sidewalks of new york and tony shalhoub 13 ghosts give solid performances, although burns is beginning to look a little onesided. director stephen herek rock star keeps the film at a fairly brisk hour and forty minutes, but somehow it seems that there were plenty of scenes that couldve been taken out and replaced with ones that would fill the plot holes. i suppose inconsistency could be expected from the writer of joe somebody john scott shepherd, though. the viewer is supposed to suspend disbelief on this one and not take it too seriously. the message is the main point, but live life to the fullest isnt necessarily something that needs repeating. this one would serve as a good rental or a mindless and safe date movie. other than that, dont expect a challenging or exceptional film here. check out the trailer first. what you see is exactly what youll get. skip it if youve seen enough.",positive
"movie fared quite well with respect to the jokes and anecdotes, cameos and the multiverse, fight scenes, and deadpool being deadpool breaking the fourth wall, etc, but thats mostly it. the plot was all over the place and the climax was way too mediocre. they didnt do justice to the cassandra novas character either. they couldve given her character a bit more screentime and we had sr many flashbacks in the film, i was hoping for one wet her character. the villain was under utilised, given her potential, as it was the case in thor love and thunder. the opening sequence was terrific and one of the best of all times. so many easter eggs and the appearance of new characters, which has opened up for exciting times ahead. i expected a bit more from a movie which served as a farewell to these fan favourite fox studios characters. with mcu rebooting the entire xmen franchise, itll be interesting to see how things unfold. post credit scene doesnt add much to the future of the mcu and is just a continuation of the filmand a banter. end credit scene is a wholesome tribute to the fox studio and its film franchises.",negative

"i remember hearing the briefest of synopsis of the truman show in a film magazine that was promoting the next years upcoming movies. it just read, jim carrey discovers hes a character in a tv show. i have to say that that description hardly blew me away as i didnt know what to make of it. saying it like that makes it sound much more simple and goofy than it really is. i didnt go and see it when it was theatrically released, but after the positive word of mouth it generated, i felt i had to see it for myself. i cant really sum it up any better. jim carrey slowly discovers that the world around him is one giant tv set and hes the unwitting star, as cameras have been following his life ever since his birth. it was actually a pretty novel concept back in 1998. big brother and various other reality tv shows had not yet taken over our airwaves, making this film quite ahead of its time. carrey plays, truman burbank, a happygolucky fella who slowly starts to realise that theres something very wrong with the world and its inhabitants who exist all around him. from there, he slowly begins to unravel the plot for himself. its all great fun and you really want to root for truman to succeed in escaping this prisongoldfish bowl he exists in. jim carrey is known for his larger than life characters, but im pleased to say that hes dialed it down here and is much less manic than his other outings such as the mask or ace ventura. not just is it a quirky little drama, but it throws in many a dose of healthy social commentary of society and their obsession with television and the characters they spend their lives watching. however, i doubt that the filmmakers ever realised how true to life this would all be with the amount of reality tv shows which were to follow it. personally, i loved it and despite it being a bit out of date now i think it holds up perfectly as a warning of our obsession with tv. for what its worth, ill mention my friends thoughts on it. he didnt like it because he thought it was all too far fetched. he felt that if the cameras had been following truman since birth approximately thirty years by the time we join him, that would mean the tv show started around 1968 and, back then, studios didnt have the technology to pull this off. i simply disregarded that as a nitpick. this film is too good to look that deeply into and risk putting yourself off enjoying the ride. i guess ill leave it up to its tagline to say it best. on air. unaware. well done to the marketing man who came up with that one!",positive
"as is to be expected, in the wake of the very successful e.t., some massively derivative imitators were released. in 86 flight of the navigator used paul reubens peewee herman voice as that of an alien ship which befriends a boy who just wants to get home. to be sure that was a smarmy, 2ndhand effort. but by far, the other much worse product came with 1988s mac and me. this was so much more appalling, that navigator was instantly blown out of everyones collective memory. mac and me is so heinous that it could melt the brains of the unborn. remarkably, the movie is so burdened by walltowall garbazh, that stealing the entire plot of another movie could be the least of its problems. an unrelated movie, called east side story, came out in 1997. its a sort of thats entertainment! of soviet era propagandistic musical numbers on topics as naff as productivity objectives, living in a workers paradise, ideological purity, etc.. mmmm... delicious! thats what you get when the machinery of state has no natural competitors. but mac and me is what capitalism would be bringing you morning, noon and night if powerful fans of cah never had their avarice checked by people who know better critics and people with taste. as one cynical remark goes if thomas edison had an mba he would have just kept making larger candles. this speedcourse in halfassed, capitalist filmmaking includes, as noted, a plot lifted intact from a more successful movie why reinvent the wheel?, takes the form of a 90 minute mcdonalds commercial you want to lose 90 minutes of selling time?, interrupted by coke commercials, has an alien that looks like a 4 dollar rubber fetus because it is a 4 dollar rubber fetus, a sympathetic hero in a wheelchair, and a script produced after sniffing the finest glue one could buy at the 99 cent store. did omebody ay macdonald? somehow the execs didnt imagine wed notice the endless shilling, maybe 200 percent more than in a typical movie, while taking their expresselevator ride to profit hell. so lets acknowledge these brave geniuses, who strived to make capitalism safe for uh... more capitalism, by name so they make it into the history books producers mark damon, william b. kerr, and r.j. louis and so this review is inescapably linked to their names in internet search results. of course there are questions that capitalism doest answer. why do the aliens heads look like human scrotums? why do they walk like babies with a load in their diapers? why do they like whistling the first few notes of happy trails to you? this is the lowest point in movie history, in any country, ever. whoever would try to displace this as the worst movie ever made must first use it as a checklist to make sure their movie fails as spectacularly in as many places.",positive

"why is this film classified as comedy? im pretty sure a film should contain at least some humour to justifiably hold the classification. seriously, schindlers list got more laughs out of me. also, an important note on satire dont satire a mockumentary character. it really defeats the purpose and suggests you failed to grasp the joke of the original material. which, if is the case, youve no place rising above your station as a nobody to consider yourself worthy of composing a feature length satire. i would have been less offended if the money used to make this film had been used to make cheap alternative to porridge out of ground up orphans. 14 of a star would be too generous. but im not allowed to offer less than 1.",negative

"this is a real story. this morning i finished my night ship at work, got into the car and drove home. on my way i got a message from one of my coworkers, who seemed really stressed and wanted me to get back to him as soon as possible. a few minutes later i got home, and called him back after parking. he said that theres a woman there who claims i trashed one of her car doors while leaving the parking lot. that was strange to me, since i didnt hit anything and my car was perfectly clean and whole. later today i realized that the woman was trying to get other people to pay her for a new door, by parking next to them and then blaming them for hitting her car, while it was actually hit from before. i called my agency and it took them a while to calm me down. eventually i did, but my day was ruined. and then, this evening, i saw pledge this!, and realized my day wasnt entirely lost until that point, which made it the worst day in my life. a stupid girl whoa, that dress must have cost hundreds of dollars! another stupid girl you mean thousands. a stupid girl thousands of dollars? another stupid girl hundreds of thousands. a stupid girl thousands of thousands. thats what i meant! this dialog is a perfect example of how shallow, abominable, idiotic, execrable, and completely abysmal this movie is. the plot is based on a first graders limerick, the acting is based on porno, and you know what paris hilton is really not that hot. most of the other girls looked way better than that silicone plastic barbie, although they all portrayed a similar lack of intelligence and acting abilities. i saw cursed once and believed it was the worst movie ever, but this movie is not even on the scale. it is a waste of money in the most horrible and angering form you can imagine. and i dont mean your money, i mean the producers money, who are probably going to slam their heads against random walls to the beat of what the heck was i thinking for the rest of their lives. if your local video store has this movie in stock, discontinue your membership at once.",positive
"ok, lets get one thing straight, this is not as horrible as the consensus of this crowd makes it out to be. misguided, lazy, and cheap? yes, but not the worlds worst film unless you really have no love for the art of stupidity. while many of the jokes are carbon copies of previous jokes in slapstick movies not the first time, perhaps the worst time, there are a few truly hilarious, timely, even satirical and keenly observed tid bits beneath the cheap muck. i think what alienates most people from this movie is the overt nature of its teen demographic perhaps moreso then the scary movies, and the fact that it seemingly just stretches out its parodies in an uninspired, exploitive manner..that may be true, but for some reason moments when they are simply mocking other comedy scenes by grossly overplaying them usually work at articulating why those original scenes were not really funny in the first place..i guess for me, having thought the majority of the scenes parodied were originally pretty lame, was delighted to see them shat upon...besides the parodies there are some decent performances and a few hysterical moments of morbid laughs if your dark humor cap is on tight sometimes they cross the line, but usually they do not...so there are some hits among at least as many misses in this cheaply put together, but more cohesive then i was led to believe movie...if you are young or at heart, and are in need of a frying pan to the head laugh, hopefully you will catch a few good ones with this flick.",negative
"for the record this is the story of the mask which was created by loki, who after many centuries tries to find it again, only to have it fall into the hands of an animator and his infant son. this film raises several interesting questions, first and foremost is why is jaime kennedy a star when he has no talent what so ever? based on this film he is talentless actor with no charisma. it maybe the film, but hes so uninteresting as to make watching this a chore. im certain that alan cumming, bob hoskins and steven wright were doing this for a pay check, but at least they turned in something approximating a performance. kennedy walks through this film like a slacker... then again considering the way the film turned out im convinced that most of the production staff were slackers. the special effects arent special. for a big budget hollywood film the effects feel unfinished and video game like. they do not approximate real, even cartoon real. its as if the producers decided that they had reached the level of the dancing baby and to them that was fine. its awful. the direction is poor. it has no comic sense. the wacky mask sequences fall flat. whats worse is that they cant even approximate the classic looney tunesmgm cartoons they copy. what annoys me is that this isnt so bad its good, its just bad. while this is certainly to be on my list of worst films of 2005, i cant give it the one out of ten it deserves, watching this i had the feeling that had this been better cast and directed this film might have actually worked. for the promise of what might have been i give this a two, however understand thats no reason to watch this waste of celluloid, this is a film best dropped in a very deep well for all eternity.",negative

"this absolutely delightful film has everything i love in a musical, and is definitely one of the greatest musicals ever made.i love them i personally think the films main merit is the electrifying choreography, evident in the songs, make em laugh, roses, good morning and especially broadway melody.as for the songs, they are superb, and quite rightly some of the finest in the history of musicals, and somehow they remind me of easter parade. the performances give a rare sense of energy and charm, particularly gene kelly as donald lockwood, also codirector. his rendition of the title is possibly the most famous scene in the movie, and is pretty extraordinary. donald oconnor is hilarious as cosmo and debbie reynolds, with her lovely appearance and fabulous voice is perfectly appealing. jean hagen is quite hysterical as lina, the source of the films ongoing joke, that her character cant act, dance or sing, and her acting in the talkie was intentionally laughable. also nice to see the beautiful longlegged cyd charisse and rita moreno. best known for anita in west side storythe plot maynt be the best merit of the film, but with everything else so good, it is such a minor criticism. all in all, a wonderful film, that is well worth watching for the song and dance numbers alone. 1010 bethany cox.",positive

"toy story is not only the best disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. the casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nailbiting climax. tom hanks and tim allen provided excellent voices for woody and buzz lightyear their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. all of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. and of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! the computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. there are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs note, for example, the subtle playing of the indiana jones theme song in the scene where woody knocks buzz out the window with the desk lamp. toy story is by far the best disney film ever made, its pretty much perfect. its adventurous, its exciting, its entertaining, its good for the whole family, its got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, its fun.",positive

"feardotcom might not be a masterpiece by any means with its weird supernatural plot, at times cheap special effects and wooden actors and actresses but it certainly doesnt deserve the loath and ridicule it has received upon release. the story revolves around a dynamic police officer and a clever researcher who investigate a series of strange deaths that have occured after the victims visited a website depicting voyeuristic torture murder. it turns out that the website is haunted by one of its victims who is seeking for vengeance. the police officer and the researcher attempt to find out more about the victims case to stop the haunting and arrest the serial killer behind the website to put an end to the violence. the movies main flaw is that its generous budget of forty million dollars hasnt been used very efficiently. the special effects are average at best, the actors and actresses are at times misplaced and the director failed to make a dynamic, fluid and emotional movie out of the script. it isnt hard to understand why this film became a box office bomb. however, the movie isnt without its merits. the atmosphere is gloomy from start to finish. the dirty locations blend in perfectly. the lighting techniques and sound effects are employed with care. the idea to show the dark side of the internet back in the early years of the millennium wasnt completely new as it had been portrayed in pulse, ringu and videodrome before but said intention was nevertheless already ahead of its time. in the end, you will enjoy feardotcom if you are looking for a very atmospheric supernatural thriller with some grisly violence. the movie is stylish, gruesome and entertaining. if you are however looking for highquality special effects, a clever plot and gifted acting performances, then this movie and genre simply arent your cup of tea.",negative

"escaping into a nearby drainage lake, the prehistoric fish make their way into a local water park during its opening weekend forcing the staff of the facility to save the guests and stop the ravenous creatures before its too late. overall this was an immensely and utterly enjoyable sequel that has a lot more going for it. among the biggest positives here is the fact that this one makes for a rather enjoyable time here in detailing the cause away from the location of the first one into a more outrageous setting being quite natural and believable as theres a nice connection here following up the effects of the first one by again using the logical manner of the underground tunnels to explain everything. that of course follows up the even greater fun here of this ones seemingly glorious cheesy nature on display as theres so much fun here during the main attack of the park that its an immensely enjoyable sequence all on its own as the actionpacked encounters are so fun and bloody that theres a lot to like on that principle alone. the viciousness of the swarm ripping into bodies and generally taking advantage of the different confines around a waterpark to make for a rather exciting time throughout here unleashing plenty of action, solid gore and kills here from the savage bites and dismemberments while also giving this the kind of demented atmosphere and fun found in numerous other works here with this one really taking solid advantage of the creatures to pile on some rather goofy, fun scenarios of the creatures appearing where they really shouldnt be. as well, the fact that this one can certainly play it straight and keep things running along nicely with some suspenseful scenes at times is a great ploy at counteracting the cheesy nature of the rest of the film where it keeps things focused on the seriousness of the creatures by featuring such great early scenes as the attack on the couple in the van as the water rapidly begins filling the van while they try to get out to safety, a later scene where they attack the friends on the wooden dock by launching themselves through the planks knocking them into the water or the fantastic nighttime attack in the lake thats really eerie and chilling for the setting and the knowledge of their attacks previously. by combining all this with the fantastically cheesy sexualized attacks on the couple that are quite shocking and disturbing, the rampant welldelivered nudity and feverish gore, theres enough here to make this one wholly enjoyable enough to hold off the minor flaws present. the biggest issue here is the fact that this one tends to go for a lot more of a clichd feeling overall here by running through the same notions as the original only it tends to feel even less impactful because of simply running along the same lines. theres a lot of similar ground covered here that came from the original, and it tends to be quite noticeable. as well, the fact that this one was filmed for 3d means that a lot of gore gags and shots look absolutely atrocious and noticeable when seen elsewhere and if thats not the format being shown in it looks awkward and clunky quite often throughout here. otherwise, this one tended to be quite exciting and enjoyable. rated r extreme graphic and occasional sexualized violence, graphic language, full nudity and sexual content.",negative

"if you want to be emotional, sympathise more than rational and logical then yes this movie is good. if you are a cinephile and rational then you can say this movie is just okay. but people are not gonna like this review. if you for one second forget that ssr is no more then watch this movie with an open mind and then youll realise its pretty average. specially if you liked fault in stars. ansel elgort was brilliant, amazing in his role. ssr is good too but nothing compared to ansel. the direction is very average and the screenplay is exactly as it is in the original film so basically there are no surprises and you know whats going to come next and only rely on their acting to make it interesting. ssr s role is supposed to be boisterous , affable and a little pompous. there is a prom night in jamshedpur , really?? ssr is wearing a tee with killer written on it. hes a flirt, boisterous , typical college heartthrob, pompous, exactly how shah rukh khan used to be in the 90s and we all complained in 2000s that how unrealistic it used to be. just when you want writers and directors to use their brains in copying. infant kizie s actings is pretty good and convincing, i would say more realistic than ssr. saif s role is like a guy out of a mental hospital. theres no logic in good dialogues and role. peter vans role had a logic and sense in how he acted that way, here hes just trying to be crazy and random. there is a visible 10 year gap between ssr and sanjana. which looks very odd to see them falling in love. there was a certain innocence and youthfulness in ansel which made him more suitable for the role. i am a big ssr fan and i am also very rational in reviewing movies. theres no way this movie deserves more stars than shawshank, rather a lot of other hindi movies. its amazing how population can take over and quantity can defeat quality. but such is the case with most of things coming out of india. quantity takes over quality. youll see more positive reviews on this film but not cause of the film only cause of ssr and the controversy around it. i could also feel he saw the movie before his demise and realised what crappy stuff i am being offered. now the music. if you have ever heard a r rahman from the 90s youll realise how average this movies music is. i wish they could have just picked up music from saathiya and dil se and used it here instead. enjoy the movie and try to be honest in reviewing. its important as a cinephile to not be biased. we cant repeat the same mistakes what the bias bollywood lobby does with their favourites.",positive

iv read some of the reviews and i agree with all. this movie almost has nothing to do about soccerfootball more about a love story. yes it does have the world cup but you see more of beckham play than you do the main stars. if you were expecting santiago munez going through issues then coming out on top in the end you have chosen the wrong movie for that. i loved the first two movies im a huge football fan but kuno becker santiago plays so little of role never see him touch a football that its discussing to even call this the last movie of the trilogy. you expect at the least the star of the first two to have some kind of an impact on this movie but if you count up the speaking parts he has in this movie it comes out to be maybe around 10 minutes maybe less. from the first two movies this is 99 different. so if you couldnt tell i hate this movie and am very disappointed in this movie and only recommend this if you have some kind of stock in the publisher so you can get money out of it.,negative

"as bad as inspector gadget and the last airbender are, they look like masterpieces compared to dragonball evolution. the tv series was very, very good, the movie was halfbaked and bland. the only good thing was james marsters, while he maynt look exactly like piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. just a shame he isnt in enough of the movie to elevate it even more. why do i say that dragonball evolution is a contender for the worst liveaction film for an animated tv series? the scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. the special effects dont impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesnt help that some of them are halfbaked. the film is also too rushed, and in all honesty i was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. the story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. the acting is nothing to smile about, goku and yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result. overall, a very poor movie. 110 bethany cox",negative

"sure its not the best spoof and not all its ideas are original but if you go to this movie and take it the slightest bit seriously im afraid you wont be able to enjoy it as much. the plot? well a typical compilation of spoofs for movies and tv shows such as meet the parentsfockers, the wedding planner, pimp my ride, the bachelor, hitch and many more. all brought together by a ridiculous clich love story not to be taken seriously. take in mind that a person with the brain of a nat can watch this and still have a meaningful movie experience. there is a flaw in the overall flick though as it sometimes tries too hard with its humor and drags itself into a boring scene. i recommend this for anyone with some free time and a cheap laugh. 710",negative

"when i saw that a dungeons and dragons movie was coming out i admit i got excited. i grew up playing dd afterall. but this movie not only let me down on the dd aspect there was a superficial resemblance, but please, a thief taking out a highlevel fighter in plate?, but was also very bad as a movie. the worst actor in the whole movie whalin got the most screen time. actually they were all pretty bad actors. well the bad guys did a decent job with the slop they were given for lines and characters. oh and thora birchs empress is basically exactly the same as the empress in star warsphantom menace. except she doesnt have an alter ego that allows her to move her face when she acts. also why does the movie have to get all preachy? the dragons are the source of magic. killing the dragons will cause the death of the world. the elves dont manipulate magic, they are magic. blah blah blah. next time let greenpeace write the stupid script. basically the story is that two common thieves decide to break into the mages tower to grab some cool stuff only to stumble upon a plot to over throw the empress. so they run away with the map and the girl, oh and a dwarf starts following them around for comic relief. although he isnt that funny, and neither is marlon wayans also comic relief although he approaches funny at times. oh did i mention the nifty computer dragons? they were pretty good. and they had some other computer generated baddies from the game. so i would suggest they make a short of this. take out all the parts where someone tries to act, except when jeremy irons is doing the crazy mage thing because crazy mages are cool and save only the scenes where there is cool cgi stuff. 210, one point for jeremy irons he came close to getting two points and one for the dragons and other cgi stuff, plus one because one is the lowest possible score and minus one for whalin boy was he terrible!.",negative

"i imagine that watching this movie is like getting a vodka enema largely pointless and quite painful. quite honestly it is hard to put into words just how bad this movie is. nicholas cage is just about as wooden as it gets. like tom cruise in war of the worlds, his character is so tedious one cant help but be ambivalent as to their fate. the movie trundles from one tedious scene to another in a story that makes very little sense and does nothing to capture the imagination. i was watching the movie at a friends house and it was honestly so bad i changed my mind about being the designated driver just so i could drink more. i had hoped that drinking more wine would make the movie more palatable. sadly, it did not. although it did make the movie pass slightly quicker which is a blessing. its bad enough wasting two hours of your life, but its far worse when those two hours seem like ten. by the time i had started on my second bottle of red wine i began to laugh at some of the ridiculous scenes towards the end of the movie. but i cant help but think that the wine made the scenes more amusing than they really are. in reality the amusement came from caustic remarks from the others who were being subjected to this drivel as opposed to anything specific in the movie. if you are planing to watch this movie, i suggest you do so at a friends house. that way you dont have to pay for it. i also strongly suggest a serious amount of alcohol to numb the pain. this movie is a raspberry shaped turkey that actually makes face off and battlefield earth seem like half decent movies. unless you are really in the mood for a terrible movie and have a sincere desire to squander two hours of your life, give this one a miss.",negative

"the wolf of wall street is a masterpiece of excess, corporate greed, theft, drug use, and everything in between. every time i watch this film i appreciate it more and its become one of my favorite films. its an underrated comedy with amazing performances. jonah hill is incredible and really became danny and was so funny with no just his dialogue but his mannerisms. to me this is one of leos best performances and this is a film he should have won an oscar for. the drug fueled phone call and drive home screen alone should have brought him the prize. the physical comedy leo gives us in that scene is a shinning light in his career and shows how great he is at playing the villain who has insane charisma. all of these people are horrible and they deserved to be in prison for much longer because they just stole from everyone and ruined peoples lives for their own gain and essentially got a slap on the wrist for it. thats why a lot of people hate the film because todays world is full of criticism of these major issues but no action. its easier to complain and try and get rid of a piece of media made for entertainment than actually down together to make change. its fun film about awful people with career performances from some of the best actors of this era of hollywood.",negative
"this is an amazingly bad movie. its so bad, it is downright hilarious. my friends and i watched this knowing full well it would absolutely terrible, and within the first two minutes we knew we had a winner. the opening narration had us rolling on the ground. for a while it was just bad, but then there was the fight with a bear, which had escaped from the zoo. first, you hear on the police report that the bear is a grizzly, one of the largest and most aggressive bears in the us. when the camera pans over the cage where the bear was held, the sign distinctly says black bear, a much tamer species. then we actually see the bear. or, at least i think we do. it looks more like a small ape with a bears head. probably because its a guy in a really horrible bear suit. ahnuld proceeds to lay the smackdown. hilarious scene. and then there is hercules sidekick, a jewish guy named arnold stang, and the most stereotypical jewish character ever. its terrible, but ironically funny. whats even more strange is that the director and the producer were both presumably jewish, and yet they wrote in a ridiculously stereotypical jew. this movie jumps into my number one spot of movies that are so bad they are great, leaping over the scorpion king.",positive
"this review is solely based on the first episode. ill update the review after the season finale. first of all, its great that were still getting content for the big bang theory universe. i enjoyed most of bbt, and really enjoyed young sheldon even more in many ways. with georgie and mandys first marriage gmfm, we get the same wonderful characters from young sheldon from mandys side, with thankfully cameos from georgies family, such as his mom and meemaw who i wish were also regulars or at least frequent recurring cast. the story so far is just ok, its basically about the couple trying to survive while raising a daughter, while also dealing with mandys parents. all of that is decent so far. heres some things that desperately need to change though 1 as most of the other reviews mention the laugh trackaudience needs to go, its both annoying and dated. one of the biggest changes from bbt to young sheldon was the removal of the laugh track, and that made the series much more enjoyable so we the viewers can focus on the charactersstory. i really hope they reconsider and remove it. 2 mandys mom for some reason seems different in character compared to her character on young sheldon. its not just her hairstyle, but it almost feels like she forgot how to act like the character. i actually enjoyed her character on young sheldon, so i think the director needs to do a better job at directing the cast to be consistent with their characters. but ill give that a pass for now since its just the first episode. 3 the music choice throughout the episode is really unfitting. using it in the opening credits actually fits because theyre dancing and i actually like it, but using it throughout the episodes feels so random because none of them are argentinean nor is there any tango dancing theme throughout the show, especially with it being so loud too. i would expect softer, poprock background music like in young sheldon, or at least music youd hear in texas or mandys family, in that specific time frame. hopefully they fix that as well, or at least turn it down a bit because both the laugh trackaudience and random tango music is loud and distracting. thats my feedback for now. ill update again once the season ends.",positive
"this really does top all the rest. the writing is fantastic. i watch all 9 series over and over as a comfort thing. two recommendations, avoid the netflix streams if you can as theyve replaced some of the music with cheaper options which certainly makes a difference. always watch the credits, the end credit scenes are some of the best parts of the show.",positive

"don lockwood gene kelly and lina lamont jean hagen are a famed hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. the studio has been issuing pr suggesting that theyre a romantic item. in reality, they can barely stand one another. one night, while on the town with his best friend cosmo brown donald o connor, lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that theyll literally rip his clothes to shreds. he hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of kathy seldens debbie reynolds car. lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. she says shes an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. later, lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees selden performing as a cute song dance girl at an industry party hes attending. she runs out of the party and lockwood chases after her, but hes too late. while he tries to track her down, he, lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927made much more difficult by the fact that lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like fran drescher in the nanny 1993. aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, singing in the rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. it also has an astoundingly rich technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. kelly and reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen kelly, who also codirected and cochoreographed, was famously difficult to work withhe drove reynolds so hard she was a much more inexperienced dancer that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. the songs are great, theyre worked into the story wellwhich is perhaps surprising given that most of them werent written specifically for this filmand the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. if for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its oftenathletic dance numbers, which can resemble jackie chans showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. its also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film. but the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. in a significant way, singing in the rain is about film technology. film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. the climax and dnouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. we see studio head r.f. simpson millard mitchell demonstrating sound films at the party where lockwood sees selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. there are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actors careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill. but singing in the rain is about technology on another level, too. kelly and codirector stanley donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of stateoftheart film technology in 1952. for example, the beautiful technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production designtheyre showing off cutting edge color. the sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. the sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well. donen and kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. this is clearly shown in the make em laugh sequence and surrounding events and the extended broadway rhythm ballet sequence with cyd charisse. showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the singing in the rain sequence. even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, its just enough coverage to produce the illusion. in the singing in the rain sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use gene kellys umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, rain is pouring down on him. while there are many musicals i like as much as singing in the rain, this is one of the betterloved examples of that genre, and for good reason. any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on dvd. if youre relatively unfamiliar with classic hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start.",positive

"ive watched the 2000 fantasy movie dungeons dragons three or four times. i have to admit that since i have been playing dd for more than 37 years, then of course a liveaction movie of aforementioned roleplaying game is something that always have been interesting. sure, writers topper lilien, carroll cartwright and e. gary gygax delivered a fair enough script. however, the storyline was just filled with a bit too much slapstick comedy, and that sort of drained away the focus from the main objective of the script, and the movie was a bit too goofy to really cater to my liking. there certainly were elements to the storyline that were quite good, but they ultimately sort of drowned out in the bufoonery and clownery. and it didnt help that they had justin whalin and marlon wayans in the leading roles. they were so poorly cast for an adventure fantasy movie based on such an iconic roleplaying game. the acting performances in the movie were somewhat of a mixed bag, i mean justin whalin and marlon wayans in a fantasy movie such as this, enough said. and then there was jeremy iron, whom was an impressive name to get on the cast list, and he truly is a great actor except not in the 2000 movie dungeons dragons. wow, his acting was so overthetop in this movie, that it just ruined the villain character concept. the movie also has bruce payne on the cast list, and he was an interesting addition. visually then dungeons dragons was actually good. lots of nice details and things in the scenes that hardcore dd gamers definitely will get a kick out of finding. lots of hidden easter eggs tied to the game. i enjoyed that about the movie, and it is what keeps the movie afloat actually. dungeons dragons, from director courtney solomon, was and still is a thorn in the side of everyone who had been waiting for a proper liveaction movie adaptation of the world famous roleplaying game. watchable for what it is, dungeons dragons is a rather nerdy, campy and sort of a guilty pleasure movie, i suppose. my rating of dungeons dragons lands on a five out of ten stars. it is by no means up to par to the subsequent 2005 dungeons dragons wrath of the dragon god, 2012 dungeons dragons the book of vile darkness and the 2023 dungeons dragons honor among thieves movies. nor is it a contender to the dungeons dragons animated series that ran from 1983 to 1985. all in all, watchable, but nothing outstanding. and my rating of the 2000 dungeons dragons movie lands on a bland five out of ten stars.",negative

"almost impossible review as a commercial movies, birdemic looks like a homemade project that somehow got a release. everything about it screams unprofessional!!! from the very basic opening credits, which are in a hideous pcaverage font, to the very long and static shots that start too early before the actors are ready and go on too long after the action or conversations have ended, which show no understanding of cutting or editing. from the terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle, revealing that there microphone was on the camera and sometimes the background noise drowns out the dialogue, to the script and acting which makes you want to throw things the lead guy walks like a drugged 5 year old, which is a shame as there are many long minutes of footage devoted to showing him just walking. and then we have to bird effects which look like a screen saver or a phone app. stuck just on top of the filmed action we see looped animations of birds which can seemingly hover in one place flapping in slow motion. the appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating, meeting the parents, visiting restaurants and driving cars before anything happens. once the bird attacks start, our gang of 46 survivors apart from all the people strolling about that are not part of the film, and the endless traffic of other cars and trucks that are also not part of the film seem to make a mad dash from the city why is not explained into the countryside why thats safer is not explained, stopping regularly to buy gigantic bottles of water, armfuls of food and tanks full of petrol, only to somehow have to drink from streams and eat seaweed and a fish caught from the ocean only minutes later, when they cant be more than a few minutes stroll from another convenience store. you need nerves of steel to be able to sit through this and call it entertainment. i can only assume this is a home movie. if it is, it must have been fun for the actors and their friends to watch once it was finished, but how actually got to be distributed and sold commercially is a total mystery.",negative

"when this film showed up on the cable listing, i had a sudden urge to see it even though i knew it was probably going to be terrible. the original was such a staple of my childhood, yet had such an incomplete ending, that i was intensely curious to see what they would do with another sequel. besides, i knew that it could not possibly be worse than the neverending story ii. boy, was i wrong. the neverending story iii has rightly earned its place among imdb voters as the 79th worst movie of all time. it is so bad that, in writing this review, i risk making it sound like its worth watching, sort of like plan nine from outer space. i assure you, this film is in no way in the ed wood category of being so incompetently done that it becomes enjoyable to watch. those moviegoers who take pleasure in seeing cinematic disasters should be forewarned about this one, lest they never again be able to erase from their memory rockbiters gravellyvoiced version of born to be wild, played in a video sequence early in the film and again during the end credits. no, i am not joking. the second film does have its admirers, and as much as i hated it, i sort of understand where theyre coming from. at least that film had a legitimate purpose, to tell the second half of the novel which the first film had neglected to do. but now the story is finished, so the third film has to make up its own reason for being, with an even shabbier budget than that of the second film. so it concocts a story that allows us to see as little of fantasia as possible. here, a series of magical mishaps causes a bunch of creatures from fantasia to be transported into the real world. these include falkor the luck dragon, a baby rockbiter about the size of a fountain statue, and a talking tree. falkor, who must have gotten a lobotomy sometime between the second and third film, will chase after a dragon at a chinese festival. what we do see of fantasia makes the place seem a lot smaller than i had ever imagined. almost all of the scenes there take place in the empresss chamber in the ivory tower, though there is also one sequence where we get to see rockbiters home just what ive always wanted to do! with mama rockbiter and of course the previously mentioned baby rockbiter sitting in front of a large stone tv set. needless to say, the inhabitants of fantasia seem to possess quite a bit more knowledge of earth than they did in the first film. when the gnome describes bastian as not exactly arnold schwarzenegger in the muscle department, were reminded how much more enjoyable the film would probably be if schwarzenegger were actually in it. the cause of these events is that a gang of school bullies steals the book and discovers that it gives them the power to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of fantasia. strangely, these modern kids never seem surprised that magic exists. think how long it took in the first film for even imaginative, tenyearold bastian to become convinced of the books supernatural qualities. these bullies, much older and more concrete, never go through such a skeptical period. and later, when the auryn falls into the hands of a teenage girl, she treats it with about the same level of awe as if she got hold of her parents credit card. there are actually some familiar actors in this mess. mr. koreander is played by the british character actor freddie jones, bastian is played by the kid from free willy, and the main bully is played by a relatively young jack black, who now probably would like to do with this film what george lucas wants to do with the star wars holiday special.",negative
"dont really know how he gets great actors in his movies. uwe boll does it again, a cast of some of the best actors in one of the worst movies ever made. the story is bad, really really bad, the acting wasnt good either even with the presence of burt reynolds, ron perlman and ray liotta. i have sworn that i wont watch a boll movie again, theyve proved to be a waste of time and money even if it comes in the shape of a 1 pirated dvd. never buy,rent, download or even think of borrowing it from a friend. its a waste, and a huge one too. and be advised never to watch a boll movie again, its enough already. edit ive posted this a while back and i just wanted to add something. if youre reading this and you happen to work at a store where you sell video games, please and i beg you memorize the name and face of uwe boll and if you see him crossing the street immediately shut your doors and windows and put that close sign. please never sell a video game to uwe boll ever again.",negative
i just watched part of it again today april 2019 and actually realized that there is a fundamental flaw in the plot of the script compared to the reality of the last 30 years. it is not the general that are crazy and want to make war it is the politicians. i like intellectual material but i have never found this movie very gripping or perhaps its satire like much of sellers is too broad for me. i appreciate his work but i always find him a bit flat. i cant rate it less than a 9 or i will lose credibility. but overall the movie still doesnt hit me as much as it does other people.,positive
"the funny thing is, in this movie they represented the war of 1971 as the 3rd war between india and pakistan in which india won gloriously which resulted a new country in the world map called bangladesh. its like bangladesh is a by product of their war. this is a yashraj films production, one of most reputed movie production house of india. in this movie they humiliated and twitched the history of the freedom war of their neighboring country called bangladesh. in the war of 1971 bangladesh fought a bloody war against the pakistani armies for 9 months to achieve their freedom. 3 million people died. two hundred thousand woman got raped. pakistan was both bangladesh and indias common enemy. thats why to save their own skin, they helped the bangladeshis to achieve freedom.",negative
"im all for suspension of disbelief in the movies. this one, however, is a huge insult to intelligence. the heroes do such incredibly stupid things throughout the course of this film that i found myself rooting for the other side. none of the characters in this film apparently were written with an iq greater than their shoe size. the film is mostly a bad remake of the japanese ringu put together by someone who apparently doesnt think much of the internet. so many elements, both in terms of story line and visuals, were lifted from ringu, that i think its safe to say that the director owes somebody some royalties. see the ring. miss this.",negative
"worked for me as it captured the zeitgeist of the engineering days very well. the bonding over alcohol, abuses and pornography. the willingness to go the distance for camarederie. the dialogues are, generally, witty. however, in this age of uber competition, the message that it tries to give about competing and not focusing on the result is difficult to digest. also, the dude who played the doctor really rankled me. he repeated the line about the swelling in the brain not going down like a broken record throughout the length of the film and annoyed the f out of me. there are many other flaws, such as sexist dialogues and cheap thrills, along with bad makeup. however, the story got me involved and made me cheer for this rag tag group of losers. guilty pleasure. recommended.",positive

"a lot of things have happened to the poor old jolly elf over the years. in different movies, hes been put in jail, kissed by housewives, tried for lunacy, knocked off a roof by tim allen, and one time a guy tried to blow up the north pole. this is the classic among them all, when santa gets kidnapped by martians. the martian kids are depressed, you see, so the martians abduct santa to make their kids happy again. campiness is to be expected in a kids movie, but this movie soars far and beyond all expectations of cheesiness. martians have poorly applied green makeup that doesnt cover all their faces. also, they wear used helmets painted green with broken antennae attached, for some reason. the robot and the polar bear are two of the most absurd monsters, and the freeze ray doesnt work too well on actors who visibly move while frozen. theres one character meant to be comic relief, but hes hard to find, since everyone else hams it up as bad as he does. cheap sets, probably left overs from a gradeschool play. nonsensical dialogue, plot holes, miscellaneous errors, the list goes on. this movie is also the source for a trivia question girmar girl martian, get it? lol is played by whom in her first role? with all its blunders and goofiness, ill give the movie one thingit maintains a cheerful approach at all times. it even awkwardly manages a message about kindness winning enemies over as friends. its necessary to approach the movie as a joke, though. taking it at face value will probably leave you bored. i suspect that the original target audience of children were probably bored, since the movie drags in several places. as a sostupiditsfunny movie, this one is a novelty in its stunning ineptitude.",negative
"despite my indifference towards the bratz dolls and disliking what they stand for, and disliking just as much the 2005 cgianimated show, seeing as there are good examples of musical, comedy and high school films so gave bratz the benefit of the doubt with an open mind. plus jon voigt has shown that he can be good if the material is i.e. midnight cowboy. although expectations were not high to begin with, bratz managed to not only be exactly what was expected but be worse. it gets points for some nice bright colours which stops it from being one of the alltime worst films, but that is pretty much the only very faint praise. the 2005 show, as very bad as it was, at least tried to incorporate some unoriginal but important morals and relevant relatable issues. this film also does both, but they are not just ones done to death in every kind of visual media in existence but they are delivered also with the subtlety of a sledgehammer and in no way feel meaningful. they are also further disadvantaged by the stereotyping, its not just one or two aspects or characters that are stereotypical. everything is stereotyped to the maximum, seeming like every one in existence, and in a way that make tea party saucers and very shallow water when swimming in the sea look deep in comparison. the unsubtlety is similarly applicable here as it is in the moralsissues bratz tries to show, the stereotypes are excessive in number, overexaggerated and a few are not for the easily offended. not in a while have more shallow and unlikeable characters graced any film by me seen by me recently, they all live up to their names as brats with personalities that never sparkle and instead make one depressed and they serve as unhealthy role models for the primary target audience. other than the bright colours, there is a real straighttovideodvd look to bratz. it strives for glitz but ends up being pure garish tack with unexceptional at best amateurish at worst filming. the songs written for the film are repetitive and irritate fast, even the worst of the songs heard in the charts today are more tolerable than the songs here. they are also sung with variable sense of pitch, lacklustre energy and nasal, and at times shouty, poorly recorded voices that are far more unpleasant than the worst singing of disney channel stars. the choreography is lazy and danced with awkwardness. calling the script stilted and shallow are insults to those words. its truly cringeworthy, forced and vapid, so poorly delivered and has no substance whatsoever. the story is nonexistent thin and would strain to sustain even a half an hour television episode let alone a feature length film. and now we come to the acting, have not seen acting this appalling in quite some time. everyone either looks like they are on autopilot or are so over the top that one feels ashamed for struggling to laugh out loud. there is no discernible chemistry between them either, with the titular characters it is hard to believe that they are friends with the way they interact and believe. of the performances, chelsea staub as meredith gives perhaps one of the worst performances ever. similarly, once again just when you think he couldnt get just as bad as his careerlowpoint, film and performance, in superbabies baby geniuses 2, jon voigt disgraces himself with an bumbling idiot role that is actually meant to be an authority figure overacted dreadfully, and no obviously prostheticfalse nose wont give you any dignity sadly jon no matter how hard you try to hide behind it by looking barely recognisable. in conclusion, lots of bratitude but no style or substance of any kind. 210 bethany cox",negative
"spy kids all the time in the world goes even lower than the previous two to the point of being unbearable. ill admit the one and only redeeming quality is at least its not like the third film and unfinished. but it doesnt forgive everything else is unfunny in so many levels. from my view, i never once either laughed or even chuckled. the film is filled with disgusting jokes and awful gadgets. the story has came out broken down and a disaster. it does not have a proper continuation after the trilogy. the action in this movie is completely outdated and cringy. the logic in this movie makes absolutely no sense. the visuals look like it cannot be afforded to upgrade considering this is the lowest budget of the franchise. and the characters are completely unappealing and have little to nothing to put effort into. do i really need to say something to anyone? dont watch this movie. im not even sure if fans of the trilogy are gonna like this as much. because this is one of the most soulless films ive seen in my life that doesnt want to continue its story. so please, stay away from this movie. im not afraid to admit, the franchise is better off to stop right here. in fact, it shouldve been a standalone film. because spy kids is an example that would be fun for the kids. but with the sequels, theyve gotten stupider and stupider and stupider. and this brings the franchise to an entire new low. this thing even feels its the end of the world for the franchise.",negative

"i was a little skeptical when i heard the name of this movie, but it actually turned out to be very funny. the laughs were all in the right spots, hit the right notes, and kept on coming. what more can you ask for in a comedy? what i particularly enjoyed was how they played off the clichs that are usually associated with time travel movies. also, the eighties references werent ridiculous they were just enough to make it work, and it seems like the writers did a lot of weeding to pick only the jokes that worked. very refreshing since there are so many idiotic comedies that think theyre more funny than they are. john cusack was good as always, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job. in fact, i think i could safely say that this was not a john cusack movie, but rather an ensemble movie that didnt really have a weak link. there were also a few moments i wont spoil them that were excellent references and surprises. this one is a mustsee if you just want to have a fun night out and laugh.",negative
"what more can i possibly say about a tv show that has already been praised to death? i was 15 when the simpsons first aired and im 25 now. ive seen every single episode, and id have to say its a rare combination of factors that come together to make the simpsons the best show ever. its a very clever and intelligent show they never dumb anything down and as creator matt groening has remarked, the simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention. there are always enough obscure popculture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadnt before. in the early days of the simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, downtoearth, unglamorous, averagebluecollarslob aspect of the simpson family. homer is lazy and doesnt like his job, bart doesnt excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. this aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80s family sitcoms such as the cosby show which always featured impossibly wellfunctioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode. an early tagline for the simpsons said that they put the fun back in dysfunctional. perhaps this bluecollarslobness by itself is nothing shockingly original think of previous tv shows such as roseanne, married with children, all in the family, the honeymooners but the simpsons doesnt stop there. this show is extremely densely packed with jokes everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to homer falling down and going doh! because its a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the simpsons living room. there are just too many things to mention about the simpsons. it can be touching occasionally more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, selfmocking irony... the list goes on and on. just watch it, else youre missing out on one of the most important elements of 1990s popular culture.",positive
"imdb should consider creating a 0 rating below the current 1. the description should read dreadful. truly, a complete waste of time and resources. this is the one aspect of being a father i can do without having to sit through an 82 minute eternity of this garbage. the acting by these two american idol stars is naturally primitive, however, one would think one being the producers who are responsible for the millions of dollars it takes for a major motion picture that someone would have given these kids acting lessons. what may even be more frightening is that this picture probably made oodles of money. sometimes it is embarrassing to be an american. miss this one.",negative

"the director starts with a long travelling shot, and we automatically add kubrick to hitchcock as directors the person behind this obviously aspires to. the first scene shows exactly how far from that he is as he fails to a get his actor walking like a believable human being, or b manage 2 seconds of a tracking shot on him without the camera clunkily jumping along. that said, visually the film isnt too bad, we get some very artistic and picturesque shots, let down a bit by lingering shots on cars, women, sandwiches and whatever else the director likes. the sound and editing is awful, cutting between shots with completely different levels of volume and ambience. i thought it was bad during the early conversations, but the boardroom and then on the beach it got progressively worse, and at times the dialogue is even drowned out. everything is super heavy handed, ranging from the constant environmentalantiwar messages to via news reports and dropped into conversations, as well as frequent comments about of money a hundred dollar fuel, a twenty thousand dollar solar panel, a million dollar contract, a 10 million dollar investment, a billion dollar takeover! i have to say though these both got funnier throughout. i takes over 45 minutes to get to the actual birdemic, and the cgi is the next level bad youre expecting maybe hoping for by that stage of the film. the scene where they fight them off with coat hangers is one of my personal highlights of the film, along with pretty much every death scene. i will give credit to the female lead, she has a bit of charm, and i find her daily activities of walking, cutting food etc. as believable as her being a model. beyond that the extras are largely better than the main cast. the young girl in particular has clearly never acted before. i wont go into more specifics or spoilers as you really need to watch it and be as shocked and entertained as i was. right, im off to watch the sequel!",negative
"the two popes is an oft amusing talkfest, if ultimately trivial and forgettable despite concerning the transitions between bishops of romethe central one of the picture, of pope benedict xvi to pope francis, including the historical rarity of retiring from the papacy. hence, two popes. plus, theres theconservativeversusthereformer dynamic between them amid the childabuse and other scandals regarding the catholic church. reportedly, the central conceit here of their meetings and budding friendship is fictitious, but it does make for a conceptuallydroll bromance. moreover, it makes relatable two men whom a great many people think to be literally holierthanthou. after their first, heated walk in the garden, which includes some intensely shaky closeups for emphasis during the arguments, the two popes is more funny than dramatic. theres the confessions of their past sins to each other, including blocking out benedicts admission related to a priests misconduct, which probably helps maintain the likability of his character here, and a bit of the political machinations involved in electing the popes, but, otherwise, its rather surprisingly fun and light fare except for the flashback scenes that make this a partial biopic of jorge bergoglio, the wouldbe current occupant of the apostolic palace. the flashback scenes are probably the biggest drawback here, as the acting and mood doesnt match that set by anthony hopkins and jonathan pryce, as the leads, in the present, as well as their magnificent vatican environs. despite the religious topic, this isnt a proselytizing picture. you either buy the signs from god stuff or you dont, i guess. although overly contrived in its symmetry of both men trying to convince the other to allow them to resign and the secret message stuff having the faint appearance of bill murray and scarlett johansson in lost in translation 2003 or something, the two popes benefits from moments such as the two sharing a meal of pizza and soda, dancing the tango, or watching germany defeat argentina for the 2014 fifa world cup. apocrypha, perhaps, but entertaining nonetheless.",positive
"im really not sure how you even begin to review tommy wiseaus 2003 feature film the room aka the infamous citizen kane of bad movies. a feature thats reputation is now the stuff of movie legend and is being examined on the big screen with james francos soon to be released the disaster artist, everything i had heard about the room is absolutely true and its hard to argue against the fact that this dire relationship drama, filled with background spoons, games of catch and randomly worn tuxedos is one of the worst films to ever receive a proper release. everything about wiseaus passion project that inexcusably cost over 5 million to make is beyond amateurish. dialogue is often out of sync, cameras at times arent even in focus, the acting ensemble deliver performances that should be studied by any potential actor on an example of what not to do, while the rooms actual plot and characters are both incredibly dull, boring and wholly unlikeable. set almost exclusively in a singular apartment in san francisco, the rooms plot line that focuses its attention around wiseaus johnny relationship with juliette danielles detestable fiance lisa, who is in fact cheating on johnny with his best friend mark played by greg sestero who looks incredibly sad to be a part of the film is so unbelievably dull and pointless that its hard to know why anyone wouldve read this script and thought they wanted to be a part of it, other than the fact the idea of a paycheck was too good to pass up. the room quite literally has one of the most unlikeable ensembles ever seen in a motion picture, with our central trio joined by the likes of philip haldimans creepy denny and carolyn minnotts annoying claudette to help create a group a people youd hate to be stuck in a room with, let alone a film that outstays its welcome at just over 90 minutes. this whole bizarre experience however acts as one of the most determined cases of wannabe filmmaking ever seen with wiseau clearly holding onto his vision throughout the whole process as both a performer and director. from reports it seems as though wiseau thought he was making some type of epic rumination on love and life, a modern day tennessee williams with the powerful drama of a rebel without a cause and to watch wiseau try and play johnny while his film crumbles around him is a sight to behold, a trainwreck you cant turn away from even when wiseau decides to show off his declothed body and the very personification of someones dreams crumbling right before your very eyes. final say a film that could be made by a group of high school students for a few hundred dollars, the room is just unbelievably rough, amateurish and downright hilarious for all the wrong reasons. if the room was in fact one giant big injoke then it achieved all it could ever have hoped for, while if it indeed was wiseaus genuine attempt at making something of power and note, this dire feature deserves its high ranking reputation as one of cinemas greatest ever failures. 0 red dresses out of 5",positive
jaws 3 is not that bad a movie apart from the fact that it is quite stupid. this time the plot is based around sea world and while catching fish jaws seems to get in and there becomes an eating spree. the movie does have many floors and is has a stupider plot then the others it is not all bad as it has cool gore in it which is nice and it was cool seeing a really young dennis quaid which is kinda nice. there may be lots of floors but it is a good movie so overall i would think that this movie may be stupid but it does not deserve the extremely low rating and low respect to it. so see this movie if you just wanna sit down and watch a low par shark movie. i rate it 54,negative

"jerry seinfeld is an unfunny comedian who somehow got popular enough to get offered a starring role or maybe he came up with the idea, i never bothered to find out because i never cared in this hilarious show about nothing featuring the daily grind of a small group of friends in new york city. jerry seinfeld is not an actor and it shows. unfortunately, since he is the star of the show and the least funny cast member, all of the other very talented cast are forced to act down to his level. but they manage to pull it off and still make the show funny, such is the talent of the lovely julia louis dreyfus as elaine, jason alexander as george, and michael richards as the slapstick kramer. they are assisted in their saving of this show from seinfelds lack of talent by characters such as georges parents jerry stiller and estelle harris and elaines boss mr. j. peterman john ohurley. newman is as unfunny as jerry. there are a plethora yes i just went all el guapo on yall of minor characters that round out the show and make it amusing and interesting. you grow to love these guys and root for them to overcome lifes silly problems. except jerry. i cannot state often enough how pathetically unfunny and untalented jerry seinfeld is, and i am quite certain that if he were not in the show, it would be one of the funniest shows ever. seven out of ten, would be 910 if jerry was never involved.",positive

"a corporate attorney and his estranged daughter journey to the sprawling estate of a wealthy ceo of a pharmaceutical company. along the way, their vehicle strikes and kills what turns out to be baby unicorn. the wealthy family who hosts them sees an opportunity for a scientific breakthrough. what follows is a madcap battle for survival with themes of social satire and unicorn folklore intertwined. what starts out as a panoply of bumbling and imbecilic characters becomes more interesting and refreshing as it delves into the mythical phenomenon of unicorns and juxtaposes the same with the animalistic greed of modern human society, especially the super wealthy. paul rudd gives it his all as an obsequious underling, desperate to please his superiors. richard e. grant has the time of his life as the megalomaniac ceo. will poulter is dynamic as his cocky dimwitted son. and tea leoni reemerges in a chilling turn as the soulless wife. jenna ortega is oddly hitandmiss here she veers between inspirational and slightly annoying, but her inconsistency isnt jarring or conspicuous. overall, the cast is quite good. the fantasy imagery portraying unicorn presence is another nice touch. dont be surprised if you find yourself rooting for the unicorns at some point. these creatures are portrayed as beautiful but terrifying as divine but merciless in their righteous fury. in the end, the film works quite well and concludes with panache. i went in with low expectations, that gradually i forgot about as things began to build up. kicking the mixed or negative reviews to the curb, i happily recommend this as escapist indulgence.",positive

"seinfeld is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, and for good reason. with its unique brand of humor, unforgettable characters, and relatable situations, it has been entertaining audiences for over 30 years. the show centers around the lives of four friends living in new york city jerry seinfeld, a standup comedian george costanza, jerrys neurotic best friend elaine benes, jerrys exgirlfriend and friend and cosmo kramer, jerrys eccentric neighbor. each episode follows their daily misadventures as they navigate their personal and professional lives. what makes seinfeld so special is its ability to take everyday situations and turn them into hilarious comedy. from dealing with an annoying friend to trying to find a parking spot, the show finds humor in the mundane. its the little things that make the show so enjoyable to watch. the characters are also a big part of what makes seinfeld so great. each one is unique and has their own quirks and flaws, making them relatable and endearing. you cant help but root for them, even when theyre making poor decisions. one of the standout features of seinfeld is the way it captures the essence of new york city. the show is set in the city that never sleeps, and the energy and vibrancy of the city is palpable in every episode. from the busy streets to the crowded restaurants, the show perfectly captures the hustle and bustle of new york. overall, seinfeld is a classic comedy that never gets old. its unique brand of humor, memorable characters, and relatable situations make it a show that everyone can enjoy. whether youre watching for the first time or the hundredth, seinfeld is a show that will always leave you laughing.",positive

"before seeing this movie id read a few scathing reviews. so, i went into this movie expecting the worst. however, i was pleasantly surprised. the film is fair, with several hysterical laugh out loud moments. i do believe that there are too many emotional threads which may have lead to the generation of so many poor reviews. there are times where the movie struggles to have heart, but fails. other instances the movie wants to have high action, which is decent. and further times where the film goes straight to potty humor, which is raunchy and pretty good. some of the characters could have been given more depth. for example, jessica albas character is fairly weak, as is myers side kickassistant. although entertaining, myers character is not very engaging or admirable. the main characters self realization is undercut by the lack of high quality writing coupled with the lack of character depth. there are some pluses however. justin timberlakes character is great. way over the top! there is some good physical comedy, and the elephant scene is hysterical. the interaction of stephen colbert and jim gaffigan is excellent reminded me of the sports commentators from bedazzled2000. i like the fact that they used real nhl teams and such, rob blake appeared for his team, and that action looked fairly authentic. i was also surprised that deepak chopra himself appeared in the film. it would seem that the script was one draft shy of finding success. however, having to satisfy the studio, nhl, and deepak chopra may have led to the weakness of the script. if you come to this movie with low expectations you will probably enjoy it. however, if you are coming to this movie expecting the next great film from myers, you will no doubt be sorely disappointed. take it for what it is worth, a 90 minute diversion from real life, brain candy, and all in fun.",negative

"has there ever been a betterlooking featurelength animated film than finding nemo? we doubt it. with its shimmering underwater landscapes be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before. the fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eyepopping, manyhued visual splendor. although the script by andrew stanton doesnt scale the comedic heights of, say, aladdin, shrek or toy story 2, it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing. i hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and offcolor humor that have blighted so much alleged kiddie fare in recent years. this is a film on e can watch with ones children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so. creators of childrens films please take note and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take. like many tales designed for the junior set dumbo, bambi etc., finding nemo taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children. it is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film. in this case, it is little nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in sydney, australia. the subject of the films title is marlin, nemos overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke. along the way, this nervous nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is. albert brooks and ellen degeneres are brilliant as marlin and dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly goodnatured fish who helps marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love. those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their liveaction performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying. as directed by stanton and lee unkrich, and executed by an army of wonderworking animators and technicians, finding nemo takes pixar technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection till the studios next release, that is.",positive
"this seeming tribute to hitchcocks the birds is a classic example of what happens when someone with a lot of enthusiasm, but absolutely no talent or film craft or money tries to make a movie. its bad in a way even ed wood or jerry warren are not wood because his love of his dreck somehow shines through in every frame he shoots and warren because warren at least includes lots of stock footage from other, competent films in his concoctions. birdemic evinces neither passion or competence it just borks along long like a piece of outsider art made by someone who saw a movie once and took notes, but then lost the notes and just winged it. hah! see what i did there?that lame pun is still better than any of the writing or dialog youll find in birdemic. its worth watching once just to laugh at the ludicrous special effects and the amateur hour acting. i have seen dozens of low budget science fiction and horror films in the last 40 years, and i have never seen worse examples of either. seriously, the bird effects look like the product of a talented seventh grader, and i cant believe anyone over the age of six could convince themselves that what appeared on the screen was acceptable. the director would have been better off grabbing stock footage of bird attacks from nature documentaries and alternating them with footage of the actors and i use the term advisedly reacting to them, like the old tarzan and jungle jim movies. and he would have been better off raiding the local high school and community college drama departments for his cast. nothing against the actual cast members, who were probably just regular folks trying something different, but lord, theyre awful. reasonably photogenic, especially the heroine,but awful. the one good thing about birdemic is that it tries to be about something, and it means well. its dumb and clueless, but it isnt sleazy or creepy, and it doesnt seem to have been made in the spirit of an exploitation movie. two stars, because im feeling generous today.",negative

"the starving games two stars out of five another movie spoof from the writingdirecting team of jason friedberg and aaron seltzer. friedberg and seltzer also helmed such loathed film parodies as date movie, epic movie, disaster movie, meet the spartans and vampires suck. they also cowrote spy hard and the first scary movie. this time they chose to poke fun at the immensely popular youth book adaptation film the hunger games. i think its their best movie yet but thats of course not saying much at all. the directing duo chose actress maiara walsh to do her best job imitating jennifer lawrence in the film. shes no jennifer lawrence and she doesnt really look or act like her at all but she does an ok job in the role all the same. walsh plays kantmiss evershot and cody christian and brant daugherty costar with her as peter malarkey and dale. diedrich bader also costars in the movie as its main villain president snowballs. the film takes place in a post apocalyptic future much like that of the hunger games in which the starving games are in their 75th year. kantmiss volunteers in the games to save her sister and has to compete to the death with other teenagers like malarkey in hopes of being the sole survivor. she also could win a coupon for a subway sub, a halfeaten pickle and an old ham. unlike other blockbuster satires from friedberg and seltzer this one mainly just parodies its main source material the hunger games and doesnt detour from that plot line. it briefly makes fun of other popular movies like the avengers, the expendables 2 and harry potter but those jokes take up just minutes of the movie or less. to be fair ive only seen date movie, vampires suck and the original scary movie out of the other films on the filmmakers resumes but i did think this one was the funniest of those four. perhaps just because i like the movie its making fun of the best. its a bad satirical comedy flick thats mostly unfunny but its not painfully unfunny like those other films. watch our movie review show movie talk at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vjsuhwoqswq",negative

"i have fortunately never been diagnosed with a terminal disease but i would imagine the shock of such an announcement would be on par with watching this movie. first off, the cast has the same racial make up as usa for africa with a latino girl hanging out with an asian girl, a black girl, and what i originally thought was some lost member of the russian aristocricy but ended up being poor even though she had a huge house and her introduction to the movie dealt w her enormous shoe collection funny, a movie that tries to break down walls still has plenty of stereotypes. example, the latino girl lives in a house with 674 people and one car, the asian girl is good at math, and the black girls parents are divorced. these girls are ripped apart by some bizarre social system whereby everybody gets placed in a group like its red china. this system is created by a girl who never seems to graduate. there is a sequence where the movie fastforwards by twoyears and this girl is still the president of the student body and running the school like the gestapo. merideth, the girl in question, is easily the worst character in motion picture history. steve buschemi in airheads is jimmy stewart by comparison. furthermore, unlike most movie that do not make your eyes bleed, this girl who spends 100 minutes raping the soul does not even get her comeuppance. like if michael vick was named chairman of peta. the characters are, sadly, only part of the problem. saying the whole portions of this movie are unwatchable is untrue, bc that would imply that some parts of the movie are. from start to finish, bratz is a step by step instructional manual on howtowhoreoutyour daughters, but keep them passionate about friendship. several scenes in particular are horrendous like a super sweet 16 party equipped with an elephant that is so mindnumbingly retarded that i was sent into anaphalectic shock and needed as epipen to be revived. finally, the real atrocity in the killing fields that is bratz is its includence of one jon voight. before i had defined the lengths people would go to pay off gambling debt or meet the daily fix by referencing kenneth branaugh as dr. arlis lovalce in wild wild west. no longer. jon voight is so ridiculous in this movie that you have to wonder if the producers had kidnapped his wife and blackmailed him. first off, they try to sneak his name in the credits so unless you are paying attention you dont even know its him. next they disguised him as if he were snitching on the mob, complete with chotch mustache which only ups his creepy factor bc he is constaly checking out the benaton ad that are the main characters. in brief, theologists have their work cutout for them since they have to explain how any higher power could have allowed bratz. even nonsentient beings will be driven insane. keep the dog away from chocolate while its on. terrorist you have been warned.",negative
"awh, man. im a big fan of the whole parodyspoof genre, i loved all the classics like spaceballs, airplane!, top secret, scary movie not actually a classic, but still even the terrible ones like vampires suck and superhero movie gave me some laughs. but, this one is just... awh, i dont know how to describe it. ok, the starving games as the title suggests, is a parody on the hunger games saga and follows the same plot of the first one. however, it does nothing actually funny with it source material, and it could. all the jokes are so dumb, old and pointless i really doubt the writers thought they were funny. the first joke of this movie is kantmiss, the main character, hunting in the wood, when her boyfriend pops up from nowhere making her accidentally shoot an arrow at a balloon with a the great and powerful oz character at it. how? how is it supposed to be funny? do the writers really think just showing a familiar face is funny? and thats my problem with friedberg and seltzer, they dont even try. all of them spoofs just show some famous character or celebrity being hit by something or popping out of nowhere like thats funny. heres an example in this movie we see lmfao and the avengers exploding, in another scene psy is shot by an arrow, taylor swift appears and starts singing, an avatar parody in the middle of the film, with no good reason, a man uses siri for throwing angry birds and fruits at a character and she cuts the fruits in a fruit ninja way. why all this? because the writers really think the audience is dumb enough to laugh at something just because they recognize it.",negative

"a simple favor is a complete 180 degree turn from director paul feig who usually turns his mind to comedy films, so this film had interested me as like its trailer had said was made by the darker side of mr. feig, and it didnt disappoint entirely. the film stars anna kendrick in her usual ditzy role but in a different situation than a character like hers would of be involved in in previous movies which was a nice change of pace, and blake lively giving off a great performance that really gave me rosmund pikes gone girl vibes. however gone girl this is not. the main problem this film faced was that it lacked tension and suspense usually found in mystery films like this until perhaps the final act, and given the trailer seems to give off the impression this is a high stakes mystery thriller didnt particularly help this fact. i would of also liked this film to maybe be a tad darker in tone as well, as at times it seemed to be an odd mash of comedy at moments that didnt perhaps need it. like i said in the title though this film is stylish, with a classic french score covering practically the whole film and the clever use of flashbacks did make this film stand out that little bit more. overall i did enjoy this film but it wasnt quite the 180 that i had hoped from mr. feig.",positive

"ewe boll, the director, must have naked pictures of some big finance people in hollywood to still be making movies because as others here said, had i known he directed it, i would have skipped it all together. but they do not tell you that in the previews often and all i saw were the dazzling array of great actors. but actors are often the product of great direction and great writing. this movie lacked both. if i were jason, or john, or kristen, or bert, i would gladly give back my fee and even a little extra to have every copy of this go the way the george lucas wants the star wars holiday special to go. i.e., with a sledge hammer! it is sad how much i wanted this move to be great! some of the back ground shots, the cgi, is amazing. the trailer pretty much has all the best scenes in it and they are only so good when taken out of context of the awful before and after scenes. in the end, what a waste. i and i am sure most of the crew would like two hours or several months of our lives back.",negative

"when i saw the cool, gruesome and refreshing monstermovie feast for the first time back in 2005, i immediately thought that this unknown director john gulager could perhaps be a talented addition to my precious and favorite horror genre that so desperately needed new blood. when i then watched the two inferior sequels my enthusiasm got tempered quite a bit already, and after seeing piranha 3dd im entirely convinced that hes just another stereotypical dumb and lowkeyed director who abuses the genre in order to serve idiotic plots, horrible computerized gore effects and infantile gratuitous nudity piranha 3dd features everything that gives horror as well as sequels in general a bad reputation. it is clearly put together too hastily, meaning that the production got greenlighted before there even was a plot in order to cash in on the success of alexandre aja originalremake, and strictly aimed at audiences who presume that horror is all about bigbreasted bikini girls and ridiculously oversized creatures designed with computer programs. my god, i just feel so old and whiny when im writing this down obviously i wasnt expecting this movie to become the next psycho or rosemarys baby, but i guess i really was hoping for a tad bit more creativity, charm and respect for the source material. the creaturefeatures from the 1970s were also far from perfect like grizzly, squirm or even joe dantes original piranha but at least they were filmed with a lot of dedication and inventiveness. yep, here i am sounding old and whiny again what keeps surprising me about these nowadays horror flicks is how the director manages to convince terrific actors to lose their dignity! christopher lloyd and ving rhames stepped out of ajas original with a relatively unharmed reputation, but here they simply ridicule themselves. and gary busey apparently needed some extra money as well. the same cant be said for david hasselhoff, as he somehow succeeds in fitting this dud of a film right into his already downwards spiral career. he actually spoofs himself successfully by appearing as washed up tv hero typecast as the baywatch lifeguard and mumbling things that are so true like welcome to rockbottom. anyways, in case you give a damn one year after the bloodbath in lake victoria, the sleazy businessman chet counts down the days to open his luxurious and flamboyant water theme park with a very peculiar and not at all sexist gimmick, namely doubled swims for free! he has even foreseen topless adult pools and installed underwater cameras, much to the frustration of his righteous stepdaughter maddy who only has a b cup. but naturally chet is a corrupt scumbag and his illegal installations pump up the water from underground arizonan lakes. those lakes are infested with prehistoric piranhas, a little detail that chet and his corrupt buddies actually should know considering the lake victoria incident, and a couple of mere hours after the grand opening the hideous razorteethed fish are munching themselves a way through silicone breasts. the highlights of piranha 3dd include a fairly atmospheric opening with images of the forsaken lake victoria and an awkwardly uncomfortable moment involving a fish preventing a young couple from losing their virginity in a romantic way. the gore is stupidly overthetop and the piranhas dont come across as menacing whatsoever. if you ask me this is pathetic nonsense, but hey, im old and whiny",negative

"the fourth film in the texas chainsaw massacre series, the next generation, receives a lot of flack from many fans of all things leatherface, but although i can appreciate why it rarely takes matters seriously and doesnt make much sense, i still manage to get a kick out of the movie. writerdirector kim henkels totally bonkers style, the chaotic storyline, and gleeful overacting from almost everyone involved ensures that, although it might not be classic chainsaw, part four can still be plenty of fun! a prefame rene zellweger plays nerdy teenager jenny apparantly, wearing a pair of glasses magically transforms her instantly from hot hollywood starlet to frumpy geek, one of a group of teenagers who become stranded in the texas woods after a car crash and fall prey to a clan of cannibals led by vilmer, a psycho with a remotecontrolled leg, played enthusiastically by rising star matthew mcconaughey. watching the next generation expecting anything remotely resembling logic or narrative cohesion is a completely pointless exercise, cos there isnt any the best approach to take with henkels crazy concoction is to just go with the flowrevel in its sheer lunacy, bask in its stupidity, but never question what is happening or why. that way, transvestite leatherface wont come as such a shock, the illuminatistyle millionaire with belly piercings wont keep you awake at night questioning his relevance, and sudden attacks from airplanes will seem perfectly reasonable.",negative

"walt disney once said that he wanted to make movies for audiences, not just kids. his goal was to produce animated film equal to live action features, movies that were seen and appreciated just like any other movies. one can certainly discuss how well the disney studio has taken care of this legacy, but the company that kept the innovation going for it has obviously been pixar. step by step, movie by movie, the people at pixar have kept outdoing themselves. to me, walle was them crossing the final frontier, breaking their own roof and kept going towards the stars. that wasnt just a family adventure and it wasnt a kids movie. it was about two machines and the entire human race a movie for audiences, dont you think? up is a companion piece on the same level. its not about the entire human race, but its about the entire life of a human being this is a movie that tries to learn very young people a little something about very old people. in the beginning of the movie we meet carl, a little toddler with stars in his eyes, dreaming about going out into the world for adventure. coming home from a newsreel concerning his biggest adventurer hero, he passes a house where adventurous things seem to be in full motion. thus, he meets ellie, a happy gal with equally grand dreams as himself. now, in any other animated movie this would be our two main characters, kids on the screen for kids in the theater to relate to. but what follows is a montage, spawning decades, and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist its carl alright, but now hes mr. fredricksen, a cranky old man. the movie has just outrun the eight year olds by 70 years or so! hey little charlie, this is your life mr. fredricksen. its dangerously brilliant. our cranky old hero has a warm and colorful life behind him, but he never got to go out on any of those adventures. while theres still time, and while theres certainly nothing better to do, carl figure its time for some adventure so he flies away in his house toward south america, the land of his dreams. his only baggage is russell, the real kid for the kids in the audience to relate to. carl finds him obnoxious and even though russell is your average modern eight year old, i guess the real modern eight year olds in the movie house should understand why by now. back in the days, all carl and ellie knew about south america was that it was america, only south. russell takes gps for granted and says youre going to south america? you know, most people take a plane, but youre smart because youll have all your tv and clocks and stuff. russell doesnt seem to have any pure, authentic dreams of adventure in him, and hes certainly not that imaginative, but he does like chocolate. what follows is an adventure as old fashioned as it is fun and original. theres something very classical about the whole fair an amazing flying machine that has to be repaired somehow, strange dangers in the jungle and giant zeppelins with the insides of luxurious steamboats. in a sense, this is also an adventure movie about adventure movies its part of the adventure to explore jungles, discover strange animals and exciting secrets. carl knew this when he was eight but now, almost eighty, its all just a nuisance. he is totally uninterested in whatever they discover. can we keep it? russell says. no carl keeps replying and continues to limp along. but its a talking dog!! russell finally exclaims. up also has fairy tale touch to it that is woven into the visual dynamic. it feels as if its taken inspiration both from the films of miyazaki, and from that elegant french style of animation that borders to realism. the adventure is strange enough to make you fall back into escapism, but at the same time its all very close to heart. carl fredricksen is as believable as walter matthau or jack lemmon were in grumpy old men. up seems to salute these kind of cranky old men too, it seems to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog, post war dream weaving. it also seems to be wanting to tell the kids of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men, because being one is not the easiest thing in the world. another thing the movie seems to be telling us is that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when youre at the end of your days, we are all children at heart.",positive

"jason friedberg and aaron seltzer are the single worst filmmakers currently working in the realm of mainstream cinema. this pair of writersdirectors is responsible for singlehandedly destroying the parody genre. i consider their third film, meet the spartans, to be the single worst movie of the last decade one which gave us a dozen well known and lesser known treasures by uwe boll. but where boll shows ambition and dare i say, style, friedberg and seltzer exhibit laziness and a lack of purpose. these two hacks throw in dated pop culture references and steal the work of others, and seem to get away with calling it comedy. it is funny to note then that their first movie in two years, vampires suck, is a parody riffing on the twilight series. the duo gleefully crib from twilight and new moon, providing us with the tale of new girl becca jenn proske who falls in love with the vampire edward matt lanter, and all the problems that come with their newfound romance. my immediate question, before even beginning to try and discuss this waste of time, is why did friedberg and seltzer ever think it was a good idea to make a parody of the twilight series? the films are unintentionally hilarious as it is. and true blood has been on for three seasons now, and for all intents and purposes, it is merely a darkly satirical and much more adult version of twilight. so right off the bat, these two brilliant minds are mining at something that has already been done. i guess it was money, but who would knowingly believe twilight fans would rush out to see a movie bashing their beloved franchise much less the haters who would not be caught dead seeing the film as it is? it just seems overly baffling to me, what could possibly have made anyone think this film is a good idea. it recycles the unintentional jokes from the series, and packages them in a way that either rips them off lightly or just come off as not being anywhere near as funny as they were before. i chuckled at a few parts here and there, but they were only mild chuckles. there is nothing inherently funny or stands out as being hilarious at any given point in the film. perhaps friedberg and seltzer are laughing but no one else is laughing with them. i had the good fortune of not having to see this movie in a theatre, but i can imagine the films showings are silent enough that the filmgoers can hear the projector whirling more than they can hear anyone laughing. i will give credit however in the fact that unlike their previous atrocities and crimes against cinemagoers all over the world, vampires suck does not deviate from its riffing of the twilight. characters still make dated pop culture references is anyone in five years even going to remember the kardashians? i barely know who they are now, but no one from other films is just thrown into the film at random. the film never stops to suddenly jump into making fun of another film or franchise outside of a total throwaway blinkandyouwillmissit gag involving alice from alice in wonderland. it stays consistent throughout, and to me, suggests a minor development of maturity on the parts of the filmmakers. or of course, they realized there was nowhere they could possibly throw someone like justin bieber or cobb from inception, and not confuse the audience even more than they like already are. but this consistency comes with a price. instead of whipping by, the film runs at an incredibly slow pace. i fell asleep twice, and somehow barely missed anything. they do a fairly nifty job of condensing the first two films, but it seems like they did not do nearly enough editing and whittling down. the film easily could have felt a lot faster paced, but it stalls a bit too much in almost every scene. and for a film that runs less than eighty minutes, it speaks a lot for what these two filmmakers were trying to accomplish or even what they wanted to show. if they cannot answer that simple question to the filmgoing public, then what is the point of even making movies in the first place? you will need to sift through the increasing amount of junk and waste in vampires suck, but proske is actually fairly good in her role her acting debut, sadly. she has the kristen stewart impression and mannerisms down perfectly, and she almost came off as a better bella than stewart ever has. she also has a commanding aura about her, which suggests she is in store for much greater work in the future. as long as she runs away from everyone involved here, i am sure she can prove this soon enough. unlike her, no one else even remotely stands out or is even half decent in the cast ken jeong and diedrich bader go to complete waste in supporting roles. they all just go through the motions, and are just as lazy and halfassed as everyone else. but then, why should they bother if the filmmakers do not even try? despite being a lot more balanced than any of their brethren, vampires suck is still an awful and truly unfunny film that only further proves the point that friedberg and seltzer need to stop making movies. even with a great lead, they still manage to botch the making of this film and still suffer from many of the problems their earlier films were plagued by. years from now, will anyone even remember these films? better yet, will anyone want to remember these films? 210. this review also appeared on httpwww.geekspeakmagazine.com.",negative

where is the passion for movie making? when the cinematic landscape of bollywood has gone through such seismic shifts and where content is becoming king again why cant we all be true to the grit of the business? there were strands and they were just being laid on the floor hoping that they will crawl and make the rug that would form the basic foundation of the storyline. but alas they strands were not woven together and neither did any of the characters have any conviction that would have helped form the fabric. they were all playing to a role but not playing the role . ranveer singh has promise but that took a break. didnt quite fathom why pc ik would lend their name! one more thing that kept bugging was why they didnt incorporate the city and the situation to the storyline. it was all in limbo from start to finish,negative
"the film the great dictator, released in 1940, remains one of the most significant works in the history of cinema. the great charlie chaplin, who played the main role and also acted as a director and screenwriter, created not only a masterful comedy, but also an amazing political satire, imbued with deep social and moral reflections. chaplin, like no one else, managed to penetrate into the essence of hitlers regime and perfectly understand the threat that nazism carried. in his film, he presented not only a satirical copy of the dictator, but also touched on issues of freedom, democracy, equality and human dignity. with his extraordinary vision and insight, chaplin warned the world against tragedies that could happen and did, the second world war had already begun in 1939 if we were not vigilant and ready to resist evil. chaplin perfectly fit into the role of both characters a jewish hairdresser and fuhrer adolf hinkel. with his magnificent performance, the actor allowed the audience to understand the difference between good and evil, between true humanity and indifference. his inimitable mimic art and bodily expression created images that still cause laughter and sink into the soul. the visual performance of the film is admirable the images and compositions of the frames, the use of light and shadows, all this serves both emphasized irony and deep philosophical intent. chaplin boldly plays on the emotions of the viewer, showing the painful reality, but without losing hope and faith in humanity. the great dictator is now not only a film about the past, it is also a warning about the possible future, about what can happen if we do not learn to respect and appreciate each other. chaplin raises things that remain relevant today the problems of inequality, political abuse and imprisonment. the movie is good. obviously not a masterpiece, as for me, but five oscar nominations speak of its obvious significance for cinema and for all generations. he entertains with his comedic essence, encourages you to think and find the strength to fight for truth and freedom. 7 out of 10.",positive
"when i first heard about this show, a remake of a british comedy, i thought it was going to be lame. i hadnt seen the original, but the very thought of americanizing a british tv show for stateside audiences sounded ridiculous. then i actually saw the show and was hooked from the starti dont believe there is anywhere else on tv where the uncomfortable, deadon, dry comedy of the office is available, and i end up laughing out loud at every episode. the characters and situations are pretty flawlessly put together, and i have and would recommend it to anyone. just for the record, after enjoying the american office so much, i did see the original british office as well. i think that, although the pilot episodes for each are basically identical, the american version evolved in a rather different direction. i really enjoyed the more bawdy, dark edge of the british office, but the american version is just an entirely different show, especially as it got into its second season. both versions are worth a watch.",positive
"this version of black christmas is the third film with the same name and same basic plot. the first came out in 1994, another in 2006 and now this one. however, i really am not sure how much this new film is a remake...its more a massive reworking of the old plots. so, instead of a mindless film with lot of females being killed, this time its a lot of politically correct feminist women being killed. and, i honestly think this strong woke feminist theme in the movie is why the film is now on the infamous imdb bottom 100 list. this infamous list should represent movies which are horribly made...films which are amateurish, with horrid acting and inept direction. films like plan 9 from outer space, robot monster, birdemic and the room easily fit this bill. oddly, the only one of these four that did make the list is the room. instead, many of the films on the list simply made it there because they were featured on mstk3000 or have an offensive and irritating message or irritating people such as paris hilton. some films clearly deserve inclusion for this reason...such as the human centipede films..which feature some bad acting but mostly are gross murder porn films with no socially redeeming values. but many dont deserve the inclusion and a worst of list should not be because you disagree with the philosophy or politics of a film or hate an actor or actress....and i think this is exactly why the 2019 version of black christmas made the list. because black christmas is on the bottom 100, i initially assumed it would technically be a mess and i was ready to hate it. it wasnt and i didnt. the cinematography was actually exceptional...with a moving camera that wasnt the godawful shaky cam but which made it look as if the camera was organic...a part of the scenery. it was lovely and showed a lot of skill. the acting also was pretty good...and the direction was also very good. now i am not saying its a great film. much of it does seem heavyhanded and the feminist message hits you over the head like a sledgehammer. but does this mean the film should be flooded with 1 votes as well as one to two sentence reviews that say, essentially, that it sucked?! of course not...this is slamming a film because you dont like the message or messenger. this would be like me giving 1s to all the films of a few actors simply because they are people i dont like. too many, apparently, hated the heavyhanded feminist message of black christmas and decided, en masse, to attack the movie. as i said, technically, the film is well made.,,but ive seen such attacks before on imdb. chances are, as a result of my review, ill receive 1001 not helpfuls. so apart from being technically well made, i do agree that the writing certainly could be better. most viewers simply go to movies to be entertained...and this is especially true of the slasher films which are notorious for being rather mindless. so i could imagine many folks going to the theaters to see a freddy kruger or jason sort of film being mad because they felt they didnt get what they expected. for some, this could be a positive selling point...but for many they probably just wanted to see mindless violence. or, they wanted to see a real remake of black christmas. for me, none of this is something i particularly want....i hate mindless violence and preachy plots and nonremakes. i just saw the film because of the controversy about it and because, oddly, i try to see all the bottom 100 i can 95 and counting as of today!. i also occasionally hated the writing because some scenes didnt make a lot of sense. a great example is the initial killing, as an icicle is plunged through a womans rib cage...which is impossible, as the icicle would simply shatter since the rib cage is so much stronger and harder than a piece of ice. i think the only way this might happen is if an icicle is shot at a person at several hundred miles per hour....and even then, i am doubtful. or, if its inserted between the ribs. additionally, the whole sataniclike possession and black blood angle in the film also was dumb...and actually diluted the feminist message of the film and was also just silly. apparently such sataniclike plot devices are common in the genre...but it really worked poorly here. the bottom line is that this film isnt great and has some problems but is certainly not worthy of the dubious distinction of inclusion on the imdb list.",negative

"what is it thats so resolutely unfunny about mission to moscow? is it the lifeless direction? the disinterested performances? the lack of atmosphere? the jokefree script? its all of these things, of course, but theres also something inexplicably poor about it that you just cant quite put your finger on. the regulars are the major weak point. while the guest cast have the misjudged enthusiasm to irksomely overact, all the usual culprits seem embarrassed by the whole thing. none of them sell their underwritten, reheated lines, and the fact that bubba smith and marion ramsey failed to sign up is a damning indictment. what comes through the screen, from george gaynes to david graf, is the sense of souls bleeding. please get me a proper job, there must be a better way to pay my mortgage these actors scream with every fibre of their being. leslie easterbrook gets her usual single my characters got big breasts joke why does she even bother to sign up for this crap? michael winslow looks old, tired, and frankly bored with the whole thing. was his involvement only confirmed at the last minute? because while he gives a curiously muted performance throughout, the script also fails to accommodate his talents in almost any way. note that this is the only police academy sequel in which he doesnt do his admittedly run into the ground bruce lee schtick. police academy managed to keep up the same level of quality between films three to six they were all rubbish. but even by their low standards mission to moscow plumbs the depths, making citizens on patrol look like annie hall. new recruit charlie schlatter, there for the completely incongruous love interest theme, is never funny and the russian characters are the crass stereotypes youd expect. any film that promises were going to kick buttski is clearly dumber than is tolerable, and a tasteless reference to chernobyl doesnt help matters. the only police academy film made outside the 80s, it was produced five years after the last one why?!!?? was there a big demand in the market for shte? some cartoon sound effects whistles, birdcall, etc. are added to the action to try and pep things up, but this really is a doa of a movie. true to form or should that be formula? it ends with an extended chase sequence that is neither suspenseful nor convincing. just look at scenes like the one where g.w. bailey gets hit in the face with stew. the stew is clearly missing his face and just lands on his chin, so bailey the only regular who tries moves his face so that the full brunt of the stew will land on it. this dedication to duty is admirable, but also perfectly highlights the sloppy desperation of the whole thing. the series move from the teen fodder of the first two, 15 certificate, movies had been subverted into the last five, pg cert entries. this is at its lowest ebb here a comedy that seems wholly aimed at the under5s and doesnt know what to do with its characters. russian acrobats entertain the kiddies while its ... er... stars... are left to stand around like second bananas, giving unfunny reaction shots. maybe its the fish out of water feel of it all, with the somewhat flat russian espionage themes failing to ignite. but whatever it is, mission to moscow feels like a tv sitcom with the canned laughter track removed. in any other franchise this would be described as an unfortunate, sad end to the series. with police academy however, finishing with one of the unfunniest comedies of all time seems strangely apt. 210.",negative

"to call this movie a comedy. is a mistake. even the last comment giving this movie a 10 couldnt even call this movie comical. this movie failed to make me laugh. and i laugh at everything. but other than that this movie is pretty well done. good cinematography. i guess. i didnt really notice because i was trying to hard to find a funny scene and everything was just kind of chuckle worthy maybe and then all of a sudden the movie was over. i know many of you will be screaming bloody murder at my claims. but seriously if this movie was showed to todays audience this movie would flop! regardless of whether it was black and white or not. so i hate to be the voice of the stupid consumer but this movie just wasnt funny to me. and by all means you can debate this to death with each other and attempt and try to explain that the comedy is much more intelligent or character based or whatever, but in a society built of oddballs and weird characters even sellers over the top portrayal of common characters president, brit, scientist almost get lost in the wash of the kind of characters we have today 40 year old virgins or wrestling monks included. not to say that these movies are necessarily better. but i definitely laughed at these ones. and i believe as a stupid consumer i speak for most. this movie may deserve the small cult following it has... but greatest comedy of all time? dont make me laugh!",positive

"ive read all the previous comments. its amazing to see someone advocating this is one of the best movies ever and someone else saying this is a very bad and offending show. very few moderate comments... usually a movie so much debated is at least interesting. i believe this is really valuable, first of all because making such a blend of humour and drama isnt easy at all. no other filmmaker did something like life is beautiful in the past the holocaust, humour and a lovely story in the same film. probably this is one of the best movies ever for bravery and originality, yes. do you want a harsh, historically correct view of the holocaust? please read the books written by survivors, like primo levis se questo un uomo, and watch original footage filmed at the end of the war, for example by the russians when they entered auschwitz, if you absolutely need something visual too. even schindlers list doesnt show the worst of that tragedy, for i believe its simply impossible to represent such an horror with a fiction work, with actors and special effects. life is beautiful doesnt want to represent the holocaust, and imho this is a good thing. btw, im italian and benigni here is a superstar you see him everywhere on tv. if you saw the cannes ceremony you have a vague idea about what hes capable to do. i saw him live years ago and hes even completely different much better!!",positive
"although this may be the worst film of mike myers career, it is definitely not the worst of the year. yes the film is ridden with penis jokes. yes there are bad puns. in the end however, the love guru doesnt fail to make you laugh many times. it does use verne troyer offensively as the butt of many jokes, and doesnt have much of a meaning, but when a film can make you laugh for most of the running time, there is something great about that. most of the jokes are hit and miss, but there are so many of them that at least a few will have you in stitches. in a time where genre spoof movies are bringing in millions, the love guru is at least a little taste of originality. we all know that myers can make us laugh, but we might not of known it would take so little. my last comment is that the love guru is very similar to leslie neilsens wrongfully accused. a very funny film that is worth catching once, because of all the laughs youll get, but watching it a second time is like cheese gratering your face. the love guru isnt that bad, but it has the same feel. worth catching on tv or at the video store if you want to turn your brain off and have a good laugh.",negative

"im trying to picture what went on in the boardroom when this film was greenlighted. with the success of resident evil fresh in the memory of hollywood, someone obviously thought that films based on video games were now the in thing. never mind, of course, that resident evil was given a halfway decent story, good realisation, and a credible cast. no, video gamebased films are suddenly fashionable, so we dont need those things, right? well, the four production companies behind this mess obviously thought so. they were wrong. dead wrong, if youll pardon the pun. you might want to stop reading now if you want to be surprised by the incredible stupidity of this film. anyway, our principal characters get an invite to some kind of party that is on an island that most mariners need to be paid incredible sums to think about visiting. the party organisers have transport, but it gets worse from this point. what defies belief is that brief snippets of footage from the video game are inserted throughout the film. yes, we know this dross is based on a video game, we dont need screenshots from said game to remind us of the fact. another thing they copied from the video game was the convoluted excuse for the partygoers and other incredibly stupid specimens to be on the island. whats even more incredible is how the heroes suddenly display skills that the audience havent been made privy to. suddenly, the afro girl can do kung fu with the zombies, and the previously green partygoers are wielding swords. one of the girls can even sustain wounds that would be fatal to men who have spent most of their lives building their muscular system. dont ask me how she does it. im sure even the writers in this case dont know. a big part of the problem is that nothing shown in the film is given the appropriate level of setup. we dont know why these people are going to the island, smuggling things, or trying to arrest each other. theyre just doing these incredibly stupid things. the dynamics of the zombies are not clearly defined, either. were never given any explanation as to why they exist, or at least one that doesnt stretch credulity to breaking point. we get some drivel involving a conquistador and some kind of experiment to prolong life, or something. why anyone would have wanted to prolong their life in such a world begs for explanation. explanation is apparently not in uwe bolls vocabulary. spare a thought for jrgen prochnow. appearing in this kind of zgrade dreck is one hell of a comedown for the man who played the captain in das boot, the yardstick by which all submarine films are judged. i know he must be desperate to appear in anything after judge dredd, but this is just silly. i gave house of the dead a one out of ten. dont mistake this to mean i think the film is bad enough to be good. it is so bad that it stops being good at about the halfway point and becomes excruciating. the only reason to watch it is for bragging rights in a contest to see who has watched the worst films.",negative
"directorcowriter bong joon hos last film, parasite, deservedly won the oscar for best picture in 2020. mickey 17, unfortunately, comes nowhere close to the high standard set by bongs previous film. its 2054. mickey barnes robert pattinson and his friend timo steven yeun are convinced that macarons will become as popular as hamburgers. so of course they borrow money from a loan shark to set up a macaron store. the store fails and mickey needs to leave the planet in order to avoid the debt collectors. he agrees to become an expendable on a space mission to the ice planet niflheim. without reading the fine print, mickey has signed up to die over and over again as the arriving colony explores the atmosphere, discovers vaccines for local diseases and figures out how to coexist with the creepers, indigenous creatures that look like giant slugs in velour warmup suits. the good news is that every time mickey dies, he is simply reprinted. scientists have made a record of all his biometrics and his memories, so a new mickey is extruded from a machine that looks like an mri after each death. when mickey 17 falls through the ice while exploring the new planet, staff assume the worst and simply generate mickey 18. but wait. mickey 17 has survived. his girlfriend nasha an excellent naomi ackie seems very pleased to now be dating two very different mickeys. but multiples are illegal. dramatic conflict abounds. bong uses this story to reexamine many familiar themes the excesses of capitalism, class inequality, the risks of authoritarianism, the reality that humans are making the earth irretrievably uninhabitable. the scenes with the creepers give a glancing blow to issues around immigration and colonialism. as with bongs previous films, these themes are more palatable because they are wrapped in dark comedy. unfortunately, there are so many topics floating around niflheim that none really receive the thoughtful treatment delivered in parasite, which was more focused, less selfindulgent. this film is fabulous vehicle for robert pattinson to show off his acting versatility. while mickey 17 is quiet and kind, mickey 18 is brash, aggressive and grating. pattinson does an excellent job changing his posture, voice and manner to effectively inhabit these two very different roles. what doesnt work at all is the development of other characters in this piece. mark ruffalo plays kenneth marshall, a failed politician who is in charge of the mission to niflheim. toni collette is his wife, ylfa. kenneth and ylfa are preening idiots whose main feature is their irrationally high selfregard. theyre caricatures, not characters. their shallow buffoonery stands in stark contrast to the better drawn, more interesting characters, particularly the kind, gentle, fatalistic mickey 17. for me, these tonal shifts were a dealbreaker. while bongs political commentary around kenneth is quite overt and heavyhanded, he pays no meaningful attention to other promising topics. for example, as an expendable, mickey is the lowest member of the colonys caste system. yet he is entrusted with one of humanitys central existential secrets what happens when we die? its a tantalizing irony left completely unexplored. hopefully, bongs next film will show a little more focus and a lot more selfdiscipline.",positive
very few shows have the capacity to entertain 8 and 10 year old girls a 13 year old boy and their 27 year old woman. like the shrek movies it has humor for youngsters and a stealthy adult humor. definitely has elements from many cartoon predecessors and often times will ground a plot on a real life issue. my little cousins love it and when they found out i was watching gravity falls at home they flipped out. now when i go visit we will sometimes watch on episode from the dvr. i literally cant stand most disney programming but the style and creativity of this show caught my eye one day channel flipping. it is worth checking out and you will most likely be extremely surprised.,positive

"if there are any real directors reading this there is clearly an interest in a winnie the pooh horror. this isnt it. i dont even know where to start in expressing the sheer disappointment of this film. whats worse, it doesnt appear to be an issue about the low budget more the direction. we have all seen recently what can actually be achieved with a small budget. it would appear this director got very lucky with an interesting idea, but has no idea how to actually make a film. our cinema was about half full, but after 45 minutes i would guess half of those had left. not because it was scary or gory or too intense but, my guess, and along with us, bored out their minds. by about an hour in the rest of the audience had broken into conversation. we left with about 15 minutes left as just couldnt take another second. on the way out i asked for a refund never done that before lol. the guy behind the counter laughed and said a couple others had said the same thing. so whats wrong with it? well, first and foremost its not scary. its also not funny or clever or interesting or well shot. it drags on and on with super bad acting, awful music, bad editing, bad camera work, dreadful lighting, terrible dialogue, super cheap looking costumes.... and i could probably go on. sometimes bad films can be a cheesy, campy good time but the absolute killer here is its boring. the world of horror has some absolutely fantastic up and coming directors and its a shame someone with some talent didnt have this idea and execute it properly. but as winnie is now public domain, maybe someone will. and, somebody needs to ban these people from ever making another film. and, i want my money back. as i was writing this review i came across a review in the daily beast by nick schager full credit to him for the below and the full article can be found onlinesocials that puts it so much more eloquently than i have been trying to frakewaterfield exhibits minimal skill at framing a unique or unnerving shot, effectively transitioning between scenes, or eliciting jolts though canny cuts or audio cues. hes not helped by vince knights muddy, shaky cinematography and andrew scott bells comatose score, which loses steam at precisely the moments that is should be punctuating the action. its difficult to fault the musicians for their lethargy, however, in light of the omnipresent amateurishness on display, almost none of which can be blamed on production constraints though its clear that winnie the pooh blood and honey was made on a shoestring budget, its failings have to do with a simple lack of talent both in front of and behind the camera. in the weeks leading up to winnie the pooh blood and honeys premiere, the writerdirector has expounded on his plans to film a series of additional childrens lit horror shows, with bambi and peter pan next in line for the grim dark treatment. on the basis of this fiasco, however, that feels like so much wishful thinking. for all of poohs kills, the greatest casualty of his rampage may just be frakewaterfields career prospects.",negative

"dr. strangelove came at a time when the cold war came closest to turning hot. both the united states and the ussr kept building more and more missiles in case of attack. stanley kubrick wanted to make a film pointing out the insanity of the cold war. while adapting the novel red alert, he realized the best way to do so was to make a comedy out of it. stanley drafted satirist terry southern to help turn the thriller into a black comedy. what resulted was the greatest piece of satire ever put to film. as if terry southern wasnt enough, kubrick managed to secure peter sellers, the most talented and versatile comedic actor since charlie chaplin and perhaps ever. sellers played three roles it would have been four if he hadnt broken his leg trying to play major kong the raf officer lionel mandrake, us president merkin muffley, and the mad germanborn scientist dr. strangelove. the film begins with general jack d. ripper see if you can spot that joke, played by sterling hayden, sending the planes under his command to nuke their designated targets in russia. he can do so thanks to a provision that allows officers to ordering nuclear bombings instead of relying on the president. meanwhile the president meets with chiefs of staff in the war room to countermand the order. the only general who really speaks is air force general turgidson, played masterfully by george c. scott. the only downside of having peter sellers in the movie is that scotts work goes often unappreciated. his facial and body language is so animated, hilarious and perfect that i devoted three viewings to focusing on it. the film adds a third setting one of the bombers sent into russia. the captain of the plane is major kong, portrayed by slim pickens, who filled in when sellers couldnt pull it off. to my knowledge kubrick never told slim it was a comedy, so he plays the straightest role in the film. the film constantly switches from the plane, the war room, and rippers base, which is under fire from us troops trying to arrest ripper. while the film has only a few quotable lines chief of which being you cant fight in here, this is the war room, every scene has something, either spoken or visual, that gets laughs. as us troops fire upon fellow soldiers at rippers base, a giant sign that say peace is our profession stands behind the action. when the president brings the russian ambassador into the war room early on, it sparks many gems including the aforementioned quote. he also sets up the phone conversation between the president and the premier of russia, which is one of the funniest phone calls ever put to film. taken out of context, none of it is amusing, yet when presented against the backdrop of the threat of nuclear holocaust, the trivialities and pleasantries are hysterical. while mandrake and the president have more lines, the best character sellers portrays is dr. strangelove, a former nazi scientist who has since become an american citizen and a weapons researcher for the us. sellers mannerisms and inflections will have you gasping for air. dr. strangelove does retain the thriller aspect of the films original intent. however, as the comedy darkens one can predict the outcome of the film. people call this kubricks only comedy, but i think thats not true. stanley applied this kind of dark, vicious humor to nearly every film he made after that. full metal jacket is loaded with it. a clockwork orange in a sense is a dark comedy, only one that deals with crime, punishment, and the governments symbiotic and mutually parasitic relationship with the media. dr. strangelove remains his pure comedy, though, and like all kubrick films, pushed the genre it was made in to new heights. this was my first kubrick film and i immediately became a fanboy after it. this remains my second favorite film behind apocalypse now. its still just as relevant today as it was back then, and its also just as funny.",positive

"stupid, inane prequel to dumb and dumber chronicles morons lloyd christmas and harry dunne during their early years in high school when they met for the first time and became inseparable best friends. the little bit of story there is revolves around the two asinine pals and their attempts to thwart a scheming principal levy. a talented, enthusiastic cast is wasted in this dismal comedy where unappealing characters run around spouting ridiculous banter and falling victim to cheap grossout gags. the two leads may look like jim carrey and jeff daniels, but that doesnt mean theyll produce the same results. a brainless farce that doesnt measure up for fans of the originalor any in general.",negative
"there is a reason this is called wolf of wall street and not lion of wall street. this is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. and therefor it was important to make this a comedy. when i watched it, i didnt think it would qualify as comedy. thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in. the way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. if you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. and that is ok, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. thats why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not. if you dont feel like it, dont watch it. save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. if it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. especially in the performance leonardo di caprio is giving. there is a scene involving him driving carefully, that has to be seen to be believed ...",positive
"anyone but you is a breath of fresh air for the romcom genre, offering a perfect blend of humor, romance, and surprisingly deep character moments. while romantic comedies often feel predictable, this one finds its charm in the chemistry between sydney sweeney and glen powell, who effortlessly bring their characters witty banter and emotional depth to life. their onscreen dynamic is the heart of the movie, making even the more clichd moments feel genuine. set in the stunning landscapes of sydney, australia, the film benefits from its beautiful location, offering a mix of humor and romance with some picturesque visuals, like beach scenes and iconic landmarks. the comedy works more often than not, with a few truly hilarious moments, though the film sometimes leans too heavily on its quirky moments, which can feel a bit forced. the narrative, loosely based on shakespeares much ado about nothing, cleverly mixes modern sensibilities with classic storytelling. the plot, centered around two characters who initially cant stand each other but are forced together through a series of events, brings plenty of fun, though the pacing dips occasionally, with some predictable twists. ultimately, its a movie that doesnt break the mold but certainly shines within it, with an appealing mix of sharp humor and heartfelt romance. its an enjoyable, light watch that works for both romcom fans and casual viewers.",positive

"i should have known this would be a disappointment. i was too excited by the prospect of jackman returning and the relatively high rating. but i didnt like deadpool 2 much and deadpool wolverine continues with a similar tone and even worse weaknesses. this is clearly not a serious movie. i get that. but that comes with a tradeoff. by being less serious, deadpool 3 has more freedom to do whatever crazy, silly, offensive, incongruous stuff the filmmakers want to. but that also sets the bar higher. if you can do anything, you better do some cool things. if youre gonna go crazy, you better go full crazy. but this movie really feels lazy, uninspired and as if its pulling its punches. reynolds and jackman are likeable in the main roles, but they dont have much to do. theyre both practically immortal and end up shooting and stabbing eachother hundreds of times. it gets old quickly. and it has no weight or implications. the actors were able to milk many of the lines, so i did laugh at times, but it leaves an empty feeling afterwards. contrast that with infinity war where the comedy has more weight because of the desperation of the situation. the comedy truly is relief, but in a comedy movie, jokes need to be bigger, better or more varied. a movie is only as good as its villain and deadpool 3s villain is awful. some bald lady doing a performance which would feel below average at a high school play. she has zero charisma or presence. just this lame intense eye thing and waving her hands around. her powers seem to be arbitrary and she doesnt consistently use them. her motivation is also unclear and uninteresting. no idea why they got this actress. the cameos were mildly exciting at first but largely turn out to be gimmicky. many characters are brought back only to do absolutely nothing at all. im reminded of sheeva in mortal kombat annihilation. sure, you get your cheap laugh, but then what? several characters are killed unceremoniously with no real wit, shock or meaning. compared to what could have been done, its really lazy and disappointing. it feels like family guy flashbacks cheap jokes and nothing more. of all the worlds in the mcu, this movie seems to build on the world of the loki tv show more than anything else. a show with no consistent rules and several mediocre actors. again, of all the things you could do, given such freedom, this is super lame. it feels like they knew they needed time travel andor multiverse shenanigans to make the plot work and so chose loki for that reason. again, its just lazy a choice made for convenience rather than passion or potential. there is a relatively serious subplot concerning wolverine but it seems like things were cut out we never seem to learn the key facts or context. i thought at least there might be some gravitas or insight with that part of the movie, but it led nowhere. reynolds is pretty good at breaking the 4th wall, but thats not enough to save an otherwise weak movie. and just because you joke about x, doesnt mean you can get away with x, whatever x might be. for example, sloppy multiverse shenanigans. oh, were joking about it too, so that means its okay. not really. channing tatum was completely miscast in his role. his accent wasnt too bad, but hes way too bulky and just not a good actor overall and not for comedy. one cameo was pretty cool, including his grey streaks of hair, even though i havent seen any of his movies. others felt ironic, like look at this obscure character youd probably forgotten about. maybe its a bit nostalgic, but theres a reason certain movies and characters were unpopular. every step of the way, the movie goes for the obvious, easy, dumb joke, rather than anything risky or more deeply creative. for example, part of the movie clearly evokes mad max, which got me a bit excited. are we gonna get some overthetop mad max style action? what other movies will this pay homage to? but no. it does nothing with it. heres a character with some history. but lets not delve into that or pay anything off, lets just kill them. aside from anything else, the filmmaking itself is mediocre. the action is generic, the comedy is generic, several actors are below average, if that. theres too much slow motion which makes boring scenes even more so. reynolds and jackman deserve better. and the violence, while generally inoffensive, is nevertheless gratuitous and meanspirited. at times, it seems the movie has nothing to offer but violence, and not very stylised violence at that. just the same things again and again, done far more effectively in other movies, in terms of vfx, choreography, stakes, style, etc. its also disappointing to see some characters from the first movie do nothing at all. whats the point? the first one was better and the sequels have gone the wrong way. nolans batman trilogy is funnier while also vastly more original, masterful, challenging and dark. the best mcu movies have much better action, acting and humour. i couldve easily skipped this one in hindsight...",positive

so this is the supposed comedy masterpiece from chaplin. well well. i agree that it has a few rather funny scenes and nd i loved the dictator of backteria. a few moments of hysteric laughter where present but overall it wasnt that funny. we have hinkler throwing a balloon version of the world around and mumblingscreaming this annoying german inspired fantasy language. and of course we have a guy who looks exactly like the tramp who walks around and acts stupid. not too funny at all. paulette goddard also left me incredibly dry in this one. but the worst part of the film is how this tries to be overly patriotic. obviously it was made as a propaganda film against the nazis but that doesnt help. long speeches about freedom are not fun at all and ruin the atmosphere completely. as stated there is some good in it too and its perfectly watchable. i just disagree with the majority on this one i suppose but i really have a hard time understanding its incredible status.,positive

"this is the most disappointing film i have ever seen. it is certainly not the worst film, but i had such high expectations because of the cast and how famous the movie is. however, as a movie, it is contrived, banal, uninteresting, uninspiring and unbelievable. in fact, none of the movie made sense at all until i watched the special features that contained interviews with some of those originally associated with the movie. then it all became clear one interviewee pointed out that the film was created purely as a vehicle to string some promising songs together, as well as to try and recycle a couple of duds that had bombed in the hope they would be better received on this outing. and that is exactly what the movie looks like a disjointed collection of music videos strung together into a contrived story. lots of other movies or stage shows have taken the same tack, such as the abba musical mama mia. and while they may be harmless fun, they would not qualify as great musicals in the way that the truly great musicals can where music and story are brilliantly woven together into a beautiful fabric that is better than either the story or the music could be on its own. it has some merit as an example of an early advertising vehicle, where the threat posed by product pitches in distorting and destroying art was not yet fully understood. but any reasonably critical view of this film at that time should have stopped this poor film and that tragic trend in their tracks. as it turned out, audiences were prepared to accept and even celebrate the mediocre in order to fawn over favorite celebrities. and that wide embrace of shamelessadvertisingasart and celebrity over quality would prove over subsequent decades to be the dominant trend.",positive

"im 21 and have lived in france nearly all my life. my cousin recommended this film to me and when i saw that omar sy was one of the main actors, i just laughed. for those of you who dont know, omar sy is one half of a famous canal sketch comedy show called omar fred. to sum it up, it is very light hearted, even silly, comedy. however, to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me. the relationship chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that omar franois cluzet were best friends in real life. franois cluzet is also excellent in this film. to a certain extent, his performance reminds me a bit of dustin hoffmans in rain man. this role shows how versatile he is as an actor. the last film i saw him in was ne le dis personne tell no one and his role in that is, literally, the complete opposite, yet he pulls off both wonderfully. i have seen my fair share of touching movies but this completely blew me away. if you have 1 hour 40 minutes of your time to spare, please, use it to watch this film. you will not regret it.",positive

"after seeing all the negative reviews of this film, i had to check it out. i heard about kirk camerons up voting campaign on rotten tomatoes and the ensuing backlash from atheists and so on. but i wanted to see if the film was really that bad. it is. its really awful, probably the most awkward, uncomfortable hour of my life. troll 2 was funny on a sobaditsgood level, so was the room. but this is just painfully bad. this film aggravates me on so many levels. but i want to leave out the b.s religious side of it, theres more than enough reviews, even from christians, attacking this film for its head scratching evangelical nonsense. instead, id like to focus on an aspect of the film that i feel has been overlooked, the historical facts that cameron pulls out of his arse. im a history buff, and this film made me so angry. cameron expects us to believe that st. nicholas got so angry with arius that he dragged him out into the snow and beat the crap out of him with a staff! he did no such thing. as one of the bishops who signed the nicene creed, st. nicholas got into an argument concerning the divinity of christ and punched the christian presbyter in the face. then theres the barking mad argument about the pagan roots of christianity which cameron dismisses, claiming that everything was created by god and therefore everything to do with christmas can be traced back to god, even the nutcracker! and on it goes... the arguments make no sense, the acting is horribly stilted and the comedy is painfully bad. its such an incoherent, rambling mess from crocoduck cameron that by the time hes dancing and doing the worm, you just have no idea what youre watching any more. worst movie ever made in the history of motion pictures.",negative

"you must see this movie immediately. it is so epically bad, that its amazing. every scene is just complete madness, it makes you think everyone involved in the movie must have been on hard drugs. the cliff scene, the mcdonalds scene, and the 5 minute scene where eric is jogging well... with his mom while a power ballad plays in the background. every scene is a winner. after each scene, you cant wait to see what madness awaits in the next scene. you cant stop. youll want to watch it again. youll want a sequel after the well be back is shown at the end, but you will never get one. the alien puppets as well as the studio this was shot in were likely burned shortly after filming completed which was probably about a week after it began. best viewed while extremely tired or under the influence of something.",negative

"here we go.... the emoji movie basically smash the lego movie and wreckit ralph together and get a sentient aubergine to write it and you get the emoji movie which is about gene t. j. miller a meh emoji, but gene has other emotions beyond just meh and is labelled a malfunction so he sets of on a journey through the phone to find himself, while also going through candy crush, just dance, youtube, spotify, dropbox, facebook, instagram and twitter... use our products. this is a bad movie straight up, but i kinda of wish it was worse. then it could have turned into so bad its good kinda film, but sadly this is just a dull, zestless, pointless and oddly confusing movie which is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long but feels like 3 hours staring at a flickering light bulb with this stupid gormless smile. patrick stewart voices a poo emoji do you want a more telling metaphor than that? the thing is for a movie about our emoji culture, it seems to hate its very subject matter, it makes fun of all its app related features but never goes full out on them so its not even a satire of this culture. and of course the product placement is just the worse. theres literally a 10 minute sequence in the candy crush world where they play an actual game of candy crush. that said the beat moment in this movie was the instagram part the characters could walk into the photo itself and everything is frozen in place which is kinda nice but ive seen that done better in other movies looney tunes back in action did that with actual works of art, with the style of animation mirroring the style of art which is way more creative. unsurprisingly this is a bad movie but no where near enough that its worth any great deal of attention. if you want to see an alright animated movie anytime soon go see cars 3 its another cars movie but thats more entertaining than this meh movie. i give the emoji movie a d .... but this was also my worst cinema going experience to date never has the audience reflected the movie so well they also were just the worst and for that the emoji movie gets demoted to an f",negative
"the script is the biggest problem with this film. it is filled with clichs and unoriginal jokes. the theme and message of the film is spelled out for the audience a million times. it should be more subtle and realistic. the sequence of events is entirely predictable. additionally, there is nothing exceptional about any other element of the film in my opinion. there is nothing impressive about the camera work. there is nothing impressive about set design or costume design. there is nothing impressive about the acting or characterization. it is emotionally manipulative using every trick in the book and there is nothing to enjoy if you do not fall for that. how it is so far up imdbs top 250 is beyond me.",positive

i have no idea why i went to see this movie when the makers of this movie friedberg and seltzer keep making awful movies.i think the reason is because i wanted to give them a chance but this movie was an epic fail.one thing i realized is that meet the spartans and epic movie are both in the imdb bottom 100 and i wont be surprised if this one makes the cut to the bottom 100.the only scene i liked was the bep part and thats all.i feel like i got ripped off.it was so lame! vampires suck achieved its goal when you read the title it sucked! i am a twilight fanbut not a huge fan and i dont think they even watched the twilight movies.this movie is a good way to cash in the money from the twilight haters.i reckon that friedberg and seltzer make much worser movies each time.i really wanted to give this 0 stars out of 10 but that isnt possible.so i think i am being generous with the 1 star rating.dont see this movie you will truly regret it.by far the worst movie of 2010. 110 is my rating,negative
"batman robin, the big summer movie of 1997, i remember seeing this in the theater when i was 12 and even then i wasnt impressed. but when i was more grown up, i watched this film again, i figured since i loved the 3 previous batman films, why not give this one another shot? now, seeing this movie once again, i can understand the low rating on imdb, this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with batman. the casting was just oh, so plain wrong. we have arnold schwartzenegger as dr. freeze?! not to mention the accent, the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. alicia silverstone as batgirl, she was alright, but again, questionable casting since she seemed out of place. now, george clooney?! i couldnt believe how val kilmer got complained about, but george clooney i can see why. he was just the most awkward batman ever and didnt fit the role at all, he was only used for his popularity. batman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle, but robin is a bit upset that he is living under batmans shadow and wishes to be the star. alfred is becoming very sick and needs serious help his niece, barbara comes to his aid and hopes to help him and stays with bruce wayne. dr. freeze is our new villain and is looking for a cure for his wife who is frozen until he can find a cure for her, he also is intending for the world to pay for what has happened to him and his wife for some reason. dr. pamela isley is a plant scientistright activist and while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs to know about an experiment on his version of frankenstien, named bang, he kills her with her plants. but the plants chemicals have an effect on her and actually make her into poisen ivy. she and freeze team up to take over gothem and of course to split batman and robin forever, oh yeah, then kill them i guess. batman robin was really beyond over the top, the costumes were a bit silly and the story was just too family friendly. this is batman, the dark knight, its not meant to be this bright and so crazy. i couldnt believe joel did this, i really wish i could get past this, i know hes going to get a bad rap for this film for the rest of his career. the acting was just stupid and not true to batman at all. the problem here was that the story and setting just had nothing to do with what batman truly is and was just an excuse to spend stupid money. please, dont watch this film if you love batman, or youll be sorry. 210",negative

"if youre considering getting into one piece, read the manga instead. one piece is an amazing series with wonderful characters, designs, world building, etc. the main problem is just the obsurd amount of anime filler that slows and stretches out the series way more than it needs to be while ruining some of the best and most iconic scenes in the series adapted from the manga. the manga has some of the most impressive and expressive art ive ever seen within any manga ive ever read, and in my opinion is much better than the artanimation in the anime. for about the first half of the series, the anime throws in filler in the shape of filler arcsepisodes, which are usally well written, and also completely skippable and optional to watch. but for the second half of the show, the filler is put in to completely slow down every single scene, making it take forever, and also ruining some of the most iconic and famous moments in the series with the poor pacing. what is over 1000 episodes could definitely be condensed down into around 300400 episodes of content. to put in retrospect how much quicker the manga is than the anime, i watched up until episode 300ish in the anime, which took me about a year, but then after switching to the manga, it took me about 3 weeks to finish the other 700 episodes worth of content just by reading the manga. the manga also has amazing art, the panels flow really well, and as someone who has experienced plenty of the one piece anime and manga, i would say the manga was a much better experience for me. not only is it faster and lacks filler, but the fight scenes are also drawn so well and flow great among the panels. the art of the one piece manga sells it. some of the shots and famous scenes just dont hit the same in the anime as they do in the manga, and as someone whos read multiple manga series before, one piece is definitely the best ive ever read in terms of qualityart. in conclusion, stop reading this review, find a website online and just read the one piece manga, its great, amazing, and one of the best series ive experienced in a very, very long time. so dont waste 1000 episodes watching the anime, and just go out and read the manga instead.",positive
"kiran raos delightful, enjoyable and heartwarming film deserves all the love it can get. laapataa ladies, directed by kiran rao, is a delightful film offering a refreshing mix of nostalgia, subtle humor, social commentary and a relatable touch of feminism. made with a budget of 5 crores, the film captivates with its cohesive screenplay, ensuring every scene is engaging and relevant. the humor is understated yet enjoyable, and the cast delivers strong performances. ravi kishan, in particular, delivers a standout performance that defines one of the best character arcs of 2024. laapataa ladies is a mustwatch for those who appreciate contentdriven cinema and films like 12th fail. dont miss it before it hits streaming platforms.",negative
"this is hands down and undoubtedly the best deadpool installment to ever exist. i like the previous ones but this is a perfectly crafted love story for deadpools character and an ode to wolverine. theres a lot more breaking the fourth wall moments, every joke is amazing and groundbreaking for disney as a company. the cameos are surprising and helluva funny but most importantly the plot is refreshing. im very impressed by the balance between the funny vibe and the more serious emotional scenes, hugh jackman shows incredible acting in this movie. the only thing that couldve been done better was dafne keen who felt a bit underused and some of her traits like yelling in spanish wasnt shown enough. but that could be directing decisions i guess. i really hope to see more deadpool films and teamups like this one. wade wilson and ryan reynolds really is marvel jesus!",negative
"silly boys. those monty python chaps send up the king arthur legend as only they could. silliness from beginning to end. but silliness can be brilliant you know. and there is some truly inspired stuff in this movie. its a farcical parody in which the laughs come fast and furious. youve got a threeheaded knight. youve got a knight who just wont quit, no matter how many flesh wounds you inflict upon him. you have knights who sing about that silly place known as camelot. and of course you have knights who say ni! you have snooty, condescending french persons and their flying livestock. you have rabbits, both trojan and killer. you have a unique use for coconuts and the question of whether coconuts can migrate. all of this surrounding the main plot, the quest for the holy grail. oh who are we kidding, there really is no plot. the movie just careens from one gag to the next. the movie is brilliantly performed by the pythons, each of whom takes on multiple roles. graham chapman, playing king arthur, is the glue that holds everything together. all the nonsense revolves around him. chapman is the straight man, if this movie could be said to have such a thing. everyone else gets to be gleefully silly while chapmans arthur is a little more restrained as he focuses on his noble quest. but chapman is as funny as any of the others. arthurs knights of the round table meanwhile are a quirky, eclectic bunch and each provides plenty of laughs as they go off in their own directions seeking the grail. and for as good as they are portraying their respective knights it is in the other characters they also play that the pythons perhaps shine brightest. how can you not love john cleeses taunting french guard? michael palin is great as the peasant dennis who bemoans the class system and questions arthurs legitimacy. palin also plays the king of swamp castle and terry jones does great as heir to the swamp prince herbert. among other things eric idle is a great dead collector, shrubber and monk. terry gilliam has comparatively little screen time but makes his own contributions with his great animation as well as codirecting the whole thing with jones. no small task pulling all this films wonderful nonsense together so gilliam and jones have to be given a great deal of credit for their directing work. the movie is really let down only by its ending. its jarring and abrupt, the pythons pulling the rug out from beneath their audience. its typical python though. but this last bit of silliness doesnt really work. for all the great stuff that came before the movie deserved a better conclusion than this. but a misstep right at the end isnt going to detract too much from the overall experience. this movie is funny, brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable from the opening credits all the way to the end. well near the end anyway. easy to see why this is one of the most beloved comedies ever. this movie which sends up the great arthurian legend has become legendary itself.",positive

"the boy carl fredrickson is a dreamer that idolizes the adventurer charles munts. when he meets the girl ellie, who also worships munts, they become close friends. however charles munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of paradise falls, and he travels in his blimp to south america to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. carl and ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to paradise falls and build a house there. many years later, ellie dies and the lonely carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. when carls hits one worker that damaged his boxmail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. however, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to paradise falls. while floating, he finds that the boy russell, who is in the wilderness explorer training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. they travel together to south america where russell finds a weird bird that he names kevin and the talking dog doug. then they meet the insane villain charles munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch kevin with his talking dogs. but carl and russell decide to protect kevin and they have the adventure of their lives. up is a surrealistic adventure full of sentiments, where the heroes are an old widower and an annoying fat boy. the first point that impresses is how touching this story is with the dramatic situation of the elder carl after losing his beloved ellie, lonely and forgotten by the world that is changing. i slightly recalled the situation of walt kowalski, performed by clint eastwood in gran torino. the annoying russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with kevin and the talking dog doug. there are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. further, it is also impressive how disney and pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like walle or the incredibles. my vote is nine. title brazil up altas aventuras up high adventures",positive

"pixar, who never seems to make a wrong step, steps right again! and this film shows no sign of a studio exhausted for ideas. this is one of their best films in fact. what i love about pixar is their attention to detail, story, and treating their characters with respect. they make complex stories feel simple and effortless by the mastery with which they tell them. and on top of that, they dazzle the eyes and are just plain fun as all get out. when listening to how they developed the story for up from the directors commentary on the dvd, i felt as if i as an audience member was being treated with respect and even being nurtured and cared for. they took great pains to bring something to life that would touch my soul and enchant me. yes, up has a few dark moments, but the undercurrent is sweet and hopeful, making the experience delightful through teary eyes. it is a must see. one note of caution because of the maturity of some of the subject matter, i would not recommend it for little little kids. perhaps 5 and above would be a good start. i feel the married life scene while easily the best moment of the film would be too emotionally hard for them.",positive
"if any other actor played liger the movie wouldve actually been unwatchable. second half is significantly better but its not worth going to theaters, at all. god awful writing paired with out of place songs that dont make sense. one thing puri did get right, is by saying his narration wasnt good at the start of the film. cause he really did stick that. i like vjd beating up mike, hated how he worshipped him tho tbh. score in the second half was pretty hype tbh. imo there should be a limit to songs in sports dramas maybe like 12, one love song and one hype song for whatever sport. i really liked vijays performance he was energetic and took up the screen presence well even with the significantly less amount of dialogue. i hated the social commentary on social media and how women dress like huh?? i thought this was a mma sports drama. absolutely trash film and an especially garbage sports drama. at least vijay was hot and fun to watch, im so glad his stutters were nothing like varun tejs character in f3. vijay deserves a better a sports drama, cause hes more than capable of staring in one.",negative

"city lights 1931 brief review another emotional masterpiece by chaplin whose climax will haunt me forever. you know i often try to separate the films which have left me speechless with their haunting climaxes, and guees what? chaplin has the most number of such films in my list. the circus 1928, city lights 1931, the great dictator 1940 and limelight 1952 are those 4 films of charles chaplin that left me stunned with their climax scenes. city lights is so emotional, impulsive and generous by nature that any person with the heart at right place just cant hate it. and beyond that, cant stop crying in the those last 5 minutes when your heart will be going through a massive pain attack. that face chaplin makes while accepting the flower in the climax is just wonderful, unbeatable and unthinkable. believe me, i will never forget that one moment as long as i am watching films in this life. so, city lights is another social plugin by chaplin but this time without any negative effects. this one is full of positiveness and kindness. with the aid of a wealthy erratic tippler, a dewyeyed tramp who has fallen in love with a sightless flower girl accumulates money to be able to help her medically. charles chaplin delivers one hell of a performance which is beyond any award trophies and critics listing. the audience will remember his act in city lights forever and thats the biggest honour any actor could ever receive. with the terrific dose of comedy and pacy screenplay city lights passes the time quickly and you dont even get time to prepare for that heartwrenching climax. it hits you and it hits you so hard even before you realise that it has just happened and it stays with you for a while even after the screen is gone blank. overall, a masterpiece beyond emotional measurements. rating 910 by samthebestest.",positive
"when the feeling of 90s nostalgia starts to wash off in an episode or two, i believe, one starts to realize that what we have here is a medley of malcolm in the middle and mother india. and the creators arent shy about it either. however, i dont think this brazen remixing should be confused with creativity. because once the clihed tropes settle in, you are left with the crux of the content. this is where the test for the writers begin. i think the core stories are quite interesting because they connect with a sense of realism for a lot of 20s and 30s something in india who have access to filmmaking platforms and networks now, finally. while this is a great thing for indian cinema and tv, it also raises the bar for originality. we cannot complain our whole lives about lack of originality in indian films and then repeat the same mistakes when given a chance. also, the urge to connect with the tropes and styles that define the show is strong among the creators. connection to mother india is obvious. the foundational structure and style of malcolm of the middle becomes evident too very soon. once you see it, you cannot unsee how much they influence the show. but, i am troubled more by the lack of subtlety in making these connections. i think the writers need to respect their audience and tone down on the cinematic and nostalgic references. they need to be there but not in our faces. unless, yeh meri family moves to a subtler style, this show will become one of the many things that happened on netflix. if they want it to be remembered, they need to go deeper into the emotional journey of becoming a teenager in india and the commonalities with kids growing up today all over the world. this transcendence can make it a great show, which it has potential to be. will the creators realize this? thats a different story. ps. dont judge an indian show or film by its ratings these days. audiences can be quite monolithic when it comes to tastes.",positive

"originally conceived for a 2003 release, the concept of foodfight seemed quite interesting and could have realistically been a fun kids film, at the time. budgeted at around 65 million, many recognizable celebrities signed on to star in the film, including charlie sheen, christopher lloyd, and hillary duff. whether true or an attempt to embezzle money, shortly before the films original release date, the hard drives containing the unfinished film were stolen from the production company. though secret service joined in investigating the crime, no clues were ever uncovered and the film seemed lost forever. restarting production in 2004, the animation style was pivoted from computeranimation to motion capture, in an attempt to save time and money. after failing to meet multiple new release dates or provide any substantial update, the film was auctioned off for 2.5 million in 2011, with the intent to release the film as quickly as possible. attempting a rush job at polishing the halfbaked movie, it was released as directtovideo in 2012. this brief history feels necessary to better understand my review of the hour and a half animated monstrosity that is, foodfight! following an original mascot, dex dogtective charlie sheen attempts to solve the kidnapping of his girlfriend sunshine hillary duff, amidst a political takeover. joined by their goofy pal daredevil dan wayne brady, they work to uncover the mystery unfolding within their store. the basic plot is littered with thinly veiled nazi allegory, brand x, and rehashed movie moments that will leave you scratching your head. attempting a toy storyesque premise in a grocery store, the rules of this world make absolutely no sense and will have you questioning how things are happening, why things are happening, and even where things are happening. the characters are one note and stale, with each becoming progressively more annoying as the story builds. sounding like the first take, the voice acting almost feels like a practice version, with the actors not yet fully building the voices of their character. even if they sounded better, every conversation is flooded with incredibly obvious sexual innuendo, which fails to come off as humorous or enticing. as basic as they come, the jokes are unbelievably unfunny, relying on repetitive visual gags and constant one liners which barely work as a punch line. topped off with an ear splitting musical number, every moment of the film sounds as if it had been run through the auditory equivalent of a cheese grater. needless to say, the animation is atrocious. akin to a rough render of an original playstation game, the characters move in a constant jolted and disturbing manner. the background characters are soulless and copy pasted scene to scene with only the branded mascots having any semblance of minimal effort. the layout of the town constantly changes, with no continuity being set, even within the same scene. the backgrounds are mostly blank, leaving all the exterior scenes looking as though they are taking place in a colorless void. just looking at any frame of this movie tells you exactly how little care was put into it. while the film plays as a rough draft, it is worth noting that there is a small glimmer of what could have been, deep deep under all of the chaos. had the film been produced by a reputable production company, this could have fit well with the other early 2000s animated films. with proper animation, rerecorded voice acting, and a few script edits, foodfight might have been a reasonably decent film. that may seem like a lot of changes, but the basis for an interesting story is present and even got its chance to flourish in 2016s sausage party, to moderate success and praise. unfortunately plagued with delays and controversies, foodfight should have never seen the light of day in its completely unwatchable condition. this truly belongs in the sewers of cinema.",negative

"death of a unicorn is a surface level satire about the uber rich being the absolute worst parasites mixed with a gory creature feature that gets a lot better once it embraces the latter instead of the former. its consistently chuckle worthy and gets stronger as it goes along thanks to the increasing body count trimming the cannon fodder, which allows the film to tighten its grasp on the best performances and elements as it reaches the climax. jenna ortega gives a great lead performance as one of the few reasonable characters in this. her bond with paul rudd is the heart of the film and he eventually earns his redemption despite starting off so deliberately unlikeable. richard e. grant is having a ball as usual, anthony carrigan is the only person besides jenna ortega youre really rooting for and will poulter has the strongest comedic timing enhanced by his spoiled brat energy. alex scharfmans direction clearly uses jurassic park and the lost world as reference points for what this is doing with the unicorns acting as both trex and velociraptor depending on the scene. its set pieces are obviously nowhere near as good as those but they definitely get the job done. the cgi used to bring the titular unicorns to life is convincing enough and is wisely employed in darkness for the most part to hide weak spots.",positive

"rollerball began life as a short story. it later became a semiclassic film with james caan. next it became this smoking pile of dog poop. the point of the movies ultimately are the game sequences. in the original they were well thought out nasty brawls of escalating violence that served as commentary on the individual versus the corporation. it is in its way the ultimate anti communist propaganda. while the original was weak but watchable off the track, we knew there was always the game to bring us back into the movie. here the game is total confusion. it is impossible to know what is going on or why. its all quick cuts that dont even remotely go together. i was forced to quickly turn the movie off because i simply could not follow what was going on. worse i didnt want to. the game is a suped up mishmash of various sports old and new and follows no logic other than it looks cool. the plotting of the game as a banned game illegal in the civilized world is retarded. the cast is mostly good but they are given nothing to do. this is simply just bad film making.",negative

"the first of yorgos lanthimos films that ive seen ive been meaning to check out the favourite but i doubt any of them will top this one. poor things deserves all the praise it gets. it is one of the most unique films ive ever seen with great visuals, costumes and acting. all the performances are great but emma stone is of course the standout. she brings a loveable wit and naivety to bella baxter and she is captivating in every scene. she is an excellently realised character and she makes the movie work. she also assists in ensuring the comedy lands every time. the humour of this film is twisted yet hilarious and the actors all do a stellar job at delivering it. yet the film also has quiet, emotional moments that hit even harder. all the supporting cast are great with mark ruffalo and willem dafoe as standouts. this film looks gorgeous. the costumes and makeup are exquisite and the sets are amazing. lanthimos direction bring this world to vivid life and the cinematography is excellent. the music further assists in immersing the audience in this weird world as seen through the eyes of bella baxter. an excellent soundtrack. if i had to mention any issues with the film, there is an aspect in the third act that feels somewhat underdeveloped and onenote. it stands out since the rest of the film is so thoroughly fleshed out. that being said, it serves as a good moment of development for the protagonist. it just felt like there shouldve been more for this aspect. this film is long but i wouldve happily spent more time with the characters. overall, poor things is a fantastic film, full of colour, comedy and heart. the film successfully tackles big themes and ideas through great acting, great characters and wonderful production. a great film all around.",negative

"sean baker returns to his wheelhouse of exploring the dingy edges of society. this is a story of tormented love, a fiery look at how a young woman, scraping by as a sex worker in brooklyn, sees her hopes and dreams become insanely real when she meets her prince charming, the son of a russian oligarch. their chemistry is instant and spellbinding. her life changes dramatically as they get married. mikey madison is miraculous as the young woman whose fairy tale dream comes alive. but unlike elizabeth taylor in butterfield 8 or elisabeth shue in leaving las vegas, the female protagonist here never becomes the classic hookerwithaheartofgold. she remains tough as nails, chock full of rage and ready to throw her next punch until the very end. while she never becomes a savory person, her resolve never wanes. she knows how to stick up for herself and rejects with fury those who fail in this regard. its one of the best performances of the year. just when you think you know where this is going, it upends your expectations and proves to be a much more challenging film with a sobering reality at its core. many have referred to this as partly a comedy. in all honesty, thats a bit of a stretch, notwithstanding a dark sense of humor. fair warning, this film is pretty taxing on the psyche. you might be exhausted in the end. but its a memorable film that will leave you in devastated awe. recommended to the highest degree.",positive

"i was excited to begin watching seinfeld, the great ratings, the reputation, the quotes, everything around me was giving the impression that im about to watch the greatest sitcom ever, the im about to experience an hours of non stopped laughs.. but what happened was something unexpected, at all.. i watched the first three season with absolutely no smile at all, and before quitting the show i watched the highest 2 rated episodes on imdb , but nothing changed ! it was childish, annoying, the acting was the only thing that is funny because it was so primitive.. i watched scrubs, the office, friends, community, parks and recreation, these are comedy, seinfeld is just something annoying that his success is one of the mysteries that cant be solved..",positive

"it has failed in every single regard. the comedy is awful and not funny. it just name drops things like nfts and cryptocurrency and uses modern slang like l and roasting to try to seem hip and cool. it is very lazy humor. it is unrealistic of a school setting. a lot of the time it feels like the teachers never teach and have so many breaks throughout the school day. nothing about it is good. here are some of my problems with abbott elementary lack of diversity the show has been criticized for its lack of diversity, with a predominantly black cast and crew. some viewers have argued that the show does not accurately represent the diversity of public schools in america. stereotypes the show has also been criticized for perpetuating stereotypes about black teachers and students. for example, some viewers have argued that the character of barbara howard is a stereotype of the angry black woman. unrealistic portrayal of public schools the show has been criticized for its unrealistic portrayal of public schools. for example, some viewers have argued that the school in the show is too wellfunded and that the teachers are too wellpaid. lack of focus on education the show has been criticized for its lack of focus on education. some viewers have argued that the show spends too much time on the personal lives of the characters and not enough time on the actual teaching and learning process. despite these criticisms, abbott elementary has been a critical and commercial success. the show has been praised for its humor, its heartwarming moments, and its positive portrayal of public school teachers.",negative

"i think the only reason i went to see this film was because of kieran culkin. what can i say, i love succession. and i certainly got more than what i initially expected. its clear this film was written from the heart, and jesse eisenbergs script is certainly strong, with some great dialogue and constant different interpretations of the phrase a real pain. benji and david have very compelling arcs and the rest of the characters, though not three dimensional, are given ample time to shine, specifically james. as for directing, jesse eisenberg does a good job on his debut. the film is wellshot, and though there isnt much in terms of variety, the film does evoke a simple yet realistic tone. eisenberg is handling some strong subject matter, and i believe he does it well. im amazed with some of the things he was able to film onlocation which makes some of the emotions hit even harder. but of course, the strongest aspect of this film is the performance and dynamic between eisenberg and culkin. both actors do a great job, especially culkin. benjis character is truly fascinating throughout the film, as the audience constantly sees the results of his grief and davids reactions to these further strengthen their bond. though theyre cousins in this film, they really feel like brothers reconnecting. overall, i had myself a good time with this film. i doubt itll blow anyone away and it doesnt have moments of extreme catharsis, but everything it does, it does quite well. check it out if you can.",positive

"this once brilliant show is now like spider man 3, the 2007 one. every, single character is going through an existential crisis that is about as well handled as the oft memed toby maguire strut montage. it took bit to realize it was going to be this bad because it was only 1 or 2 of them to start with, evolving over several episodes with inciters that the viewer could see. every additional character they did it with was handled more poorly until we get mnms breakdown that comes out of nowhere and relies the most lazy, poorly established shorthand. its great when a show can explore trauma in an authentic, human way. there is space for that in shows and it makes them better. but when its every character of the entire cast and devolves to the level of sophistication of psas and childrens cartoon? come on! and the rest of the show goes the same. the allegory isnt even allegory any more. it was more patent in season 3 and now is completely lacking any nuance or subtlety.",positive
"at this point in my life i question a bunch of things what happens when we die, is there life out there? i can finally add another question to my list why does netflix keep making these movies?! its obviously cheap and easy to make. but, like its predecessor it does absolutely nothing to improve character development there is none, or remain interesting. i dont know what the appeal is of this series anymore. its not sexy, if youre looking for that theres superior content on the internet. theres no story, youll find a more compelling one in the room hi mark!, and not a single character that is even remotely realistic.",negative
"after seeing this one, all i can say is that for some reason they needed a film to flop. at the moment i cant imagine what kind of tragic loop hole in the studio fiscal numbers could have prompted them to do this but i pose the question why dragon ball?!! if for some reason this film was the result of poor research and disregard for authenticity, then both ben wong and mainly ben ramsey should be stung up by their feet and pelted with bile and human waste. it doesnt even help that they added evolution instead of z which would have really spawned a violent reaction from a large fan community. hands down, already one of the top 4 worst film adaptations ever made. dont waste your money or time on this slovenly ball of hollywood horse manure. i still dont know why or who gave this film the green light. i mean goku is cast as a white teenager in high school!!!! that to me is an indication to forget this film ever existed. this is definitely a bad move for dune entertainment. id say try the wolverine film instead of this crap. but even so, why have any faith with the same group the messed up max panye, and made xmen 3. ha! i dont care if they read this, they need to anyway. daniel kahn nelson",negative

"so, im not going to bash this film as bad as others have, but im also not going to say this film is great by any stretch of the imagination. when this film came out in 1997, it was bashed so bad by the critics, was quickly becoming a box office flop and the idea of shaquille oneal being the main actor in anything, was totally turning me off and the rest of the world. i never even thought of seeing this movie back then, because of all the bad press. on top of all the bad press, dc comicsproduced movies were meeting a major downturn in quality and success during this time. this film was released two months after the disastrous release of the hated batman robin 1997, film. things would actually not begin to improve for dc until 2005, when director christopher nolan released batman begins 2005. also, forget about marvel during the 1990s. they had nothing really going on up to this point, although things would change for them, moving forward, with the release of blade 1998, the following year. so, its fair to say that comic book fans in 1997 were not happy to begin with. it is fair to say, that some creators of motion pictures sometimes tend to mess things up when they are petprojects. that is how things kind of rolled out here with the production of this film. shaq was a big fan of the character of steel. television producer, david salzman and legendary music performer, with money to burn, quincy jones, also loved the character. when a major nba superstar says he wants to make a movie about steel, then you just do it. thats where the trouble begins. they hired legendary television, directorproducerwriter, kenneth johnson, to direct this film. why they would hire a television guy to direct a major motion picture? well, lets check his resume. johnson was responsible for the creation of some of the best moments in fantasyscience fiction television history, from the 1970s to 1990s. he has huge titles on his list. tv shows like, the bionic woman 19761978, the incredible hulk 19771982, v 19831985 and alien nation 19891990, just to name a few. he definitely had the experience in fantasy, science fiction and comic book adaptations. the problem was it was for television and that is what comes out of the screen in steel 1997. it feels like a cheesy tv show, not a major motion picture. it is true this film has terrible dialogue, silly oneliners and certain moments in the film, that really make you want to shake your head. having shaquille oneal as your main character is not a good choice. someone at warner brothers, should have gotten into salzmans ear and convinced him to get shaq to just be a producer on the film and hired a real actor for the job. you get scored on your preproduction as much as the production and postproduction too. it sounds like the choice of shaq was a huge turnoff for many theatergoers and critics. what also made things annoying to the fans for this film, was the blatant ignorance towards the original source material and the removal of the true story of steel. without getting into the full backstory to this character too much, steel really shouldnt be around without superman nearby. steel is an important supporting character to superman and that aspect was totally ignored in this movie. maybe, i am used to watching the cwdc superhero shows, that we see today in the 21st century. as i witness the demise of the, once respected, arrowverse, from the cw and the coming end to those shows, steel 1997, doesnt look any worse than the weaker days of the arrowverse. maybe steel 1997, was ahead of its time, because it follows the same formula as those shows. this speaks volumes, because steel 1997, should have been a tv movie. there are some good moments in this film, mostly related to irons relationships with his friends and family. the writers do try to build a good foundation with the main character, by developing the family iron has around him. this includes his grandmother, but also could include his uncle joe richard roundtree or his commanding officer, colonel david charles napier. so, with all these negatives floating around in the press, total avoidance of the original source material and egos sabotaging beloved characters, you have a recipe for disaster. throw in bad interactions between characters, a cheesy tv aura and some messy editing and you are going to score low on your film. i still dont think this film is as bad as some say, so i am going to give it an e for effort. it is interestingly funny, seeing steels arch enemy, nathaniel burke played fairly well by judd nelson, trying to pick a fight with oneals, john henry irons, while looking up at irons, like hes talking to someone on top of the washington monument. the interaction between the two characters just looked silly. this film can go either way. it can be fun at times, but also has some painful moments in it. 4.6 e mygrade 5 imdb.",negative
"we stay moving, we stay light, we stay agile. benji kaplan kieran culkin a real pain is a comedy, yes, handily crafted by writerdirector jesse eisenberg, yet it is also a serious drama about the differences between two jewish cousins traveling poland in honor of their recently deceased grandmother, a holocaust survivor. this buddy film is a study of two different characters and their relationship to each other and their jewish history. david eisenberg is john miltons il penseroso and benji is his lallegro, two opposites, the former characterized by melancholy and the latter mirth. david is the grounded, nerdy, contemplative one and benji kieran culkin the offthewall motormouth whose joys nevertheless bear thinking about. his advice above to david to stay cool as they avoid paying for their train ticket has davids careful thinking combined with benjis chutzpa. less the bipolar nut, benji is rather a funny, smart boyman too smart to say stupid things and too immature to tone it down. the sympathetic soul of the movie is in his character, who connects with the other holocaust tourists in an inspired way that makes them remember him. when they tour a concentration camp, however, barely a word is spoken as if the history of the genocide weighs too heavily for words. only benjis words that advise the guide, nonjewish james will sharpe, to find the real emotion in the statistics he offers, make a difference. although benji can be opinionated, he resonates with the pleasant rwandan, eloge kurt egyiawan, a convert to judaism, and middleaged marcia jennifer gray, a melancholic waiting to be freed from her sadness over her divorce. writerdirector eisenberg never allows either character to gain our censure. despite benjis recently severe dark moment, david worries about his rootless, charismatic cousin. the director shows gently the complexity of human personality and the differences family members have no matter the circumstances. even more than a balanced depiction of two completely different relatives, a real pain shows the emotional benefits of lallegro and the grounded reality of il penseroso. they are, after all, blood relatives, almost brothers, who are vastly different but under the history of the holocaust and their grandmother, just like the rest of us trying to understand the horror and the joy of living. a buddy movie it is, but all about words, not action as in butch cassady and the sundance kid. this light comedydrama should be a heavyweight contender for oscar.",negative
"the only positive about this film is that it gives you a newfound appreciation for the most fundamentals of film and cinema. things like scene continuity, framing, sound quality, voice synchronisation, corpses not moving, acting which would at least pass 8thgrade drama class. if it had been a halfhour shorter id recommend it as being so bad, its good, but as it is, nobody aside from film students should sit and watch this.",negative
"im probably not saying anything new here that somebody already hasnt said in a review but i just got done watching this and the only reason being was to see how bad it actually was. first major gripe i had with it was the writing and the dialogue are awful. the writers didnt think a lot through. there were so many loose ends and things that went unexplained. they were just waiting for their next paycheck. second gripe i had with it was that the acting is terrible. ive never been much of a cage fan and the rest of the cast werent any better either. a good rule of thumb i go by is that if you can tell they are acting they arent doing a good job. good actors sell their roles and convince you. needless to say i wasnt convinced. im not a very harsh critic and if a movie entertains me it did its job but when a movie is this blatantly bad it can make anybody a harsh critic. overall, a poor movie. just dont see it. dont waste your time.",negative

"im not sure which is worse in this series for netflix the story, the acting or the pure, derelict destruction of the addams family memory. the story puts wednesday in a mystery to solve, turning her into a emotionless nancy drew style character or angsty drew. the mystery is not that deep or involved, so i hoped the characters would shine out, but sadly not. the addams family members are completely new characters, full of emotion and empathy, making them nothing like the original addams family members. they all seem to phone in their performances too. the wider cast is ok, but seeing christina ricci makes you feel sad that shes not playing an older wednesday in a more adult story, which would have been much more enjoyable. the performance by thing the hand overwhelmingly outshines every other actor when its on screen. all the nuance and emotion missing or misplaced in the other characters shines from the performance of a single hand. for teenagers who loved those boy wizard movies, or angsty teen dramas like riverdale, this is for you. for anyone else, especially hardcore fans of addams family series or movies, please avoid.",positive

"uwe bol has made some terrible films. i certainly wont defend his making crap like house of the dead and alone in the dark. and, i noticed that quite a few of his films are on imdbs infamous bottom 100 list...including this movie. but i also noticed that in the name of the king a dungeon siege tale, despite its pathetic score of 3.8 that its really not a bad film. flawed, yes...but overall rather enjoyable if you like fantasy films. the story is about an evil sorcerer ray liotta who is in league with a pathetic wiener, the kings nephew matthew lilliard. and, using the sorcerers power, he is able to make the brainless krug attack the people of ehb and in the surrounding countryside. amazingly, the fate of the people all rests on the back of a simple farmer jason statham and his small band of allies. so what are the films weaknesses...other than having uwe bols name on the picture? some of the characters in particular, statham are underwritten and wooden and a few of the casting decisions are strange...though they mostly work. some of the dialog is a bit silly. and, sometimes the film was very easy to predict. but, if you turn off your brain and just enjoy the story, the great music and the lovely big cinematography, there is a good movie here. great? certainly not...but not a bad film at all...and one i found i enjoyed even though i was totally expecting to hate it. by the way, i noticed some reviewers called it, essentially, a bad lord of the rings knockoff. despite having john rhysdavies, the film really didnt seem to be trying to copy the trilogy. the closest movie to this one might be one more like krull or conan...which is also quite watchable.",negative
"this film is completely offthewall crazy. it is one of those rare films that has the power to descend to the depths of insanity, dragging its helpless audience along with it, until wham! the phrase aspergers in your burgers is uttered by a man holding a cup of coffee in front of his mouth. the madness is universally expressed by all characters present, leading to an unsettling conclusion this is not about jesus at all, but a tale of a party in which the hot chocolate somehow becomes contaminated with marijuana. suddenly the strange giggling in the car, the hallucinogenic santa segment and the random conspiracy theory scene with two minor characters makes sense when viewed this way. it makes more sense than the idea someone thought this movie was a good idea, anyway!",negative
"there may never be another filmmaker like quentin tarantino. if there is, we surely are in luck. but in all likelihood, future generations will just be students of his, and thank god for that fact alone. hes a filmmakers filmmaker. his love of cinema verges on fetishism. his mission in life, it seems, was to keep his celluloid memories alive and in the american psyche in a time long past its expiration date. so long as theres a reel and a way, tarantino will give you a ticket to the greatest shows on earth, filled with filthy language and splattering gore violence. once upon a time in hollywood is his 9th feature film. its been announced as his second to last film. rumor has it, if the film basks in an exponentially warm reception, this could be his last film. i pray we can all sit down one last time for the number 10, but if quentin is seriously considering it, ill warmly and happily accept that. the truth is, its all been leading up to this moment. quentins personal crescendo, encapsulating all he has learned and all he has experienced as a man living in hollywood and a successful filmmaker from within it. he went for it, and he did it. once upon a time in hollywood is the best film of 2019, and easily his best film since pulp fiction. for me, nothing short of perfect. everything i wanted it to be, and yet it still shocked and surprised me. im convinced that after the second and even third viewings, ill still find new things to love about it. for nearly three hours in length, it grabs you up from your seat and never lets go. heres the story. the year is 1969. we meet the dashing rick dalton leonardo dicaprio and his frisky stuntman sidekick, cliff booth brad pitt. the dynamic duo of black and white television, and old, gunslinging cowboy movies. they were the best, they were the most handsome and they were the most talented. they were the best actors in hollywood.. until now. after an unkindly meeting with his agent, marvin schwartz played in outrageous fashion by the great al pacino, rick is told in no uncertain terms that his time as a leading man is over. in other words, hes lost everything. reduced to playing walkon roles in late60s tv shows, and bgrade italian spaghetti westerns that nobody will ever see. devastated, he returns to sulk in his luxury home in the hollywood hills, while cliff goes home to a dingy trailer nextdoor to a drivein movie theater, to feed his loyal pitbull brandy. california dreaming is not all that it seems. but wouldnt you know it, rick dalton has a new neighbor. one roman polanksi and his wife, superstar sharon tate margot robbie. the contrast doesnt get much starker. as rick dalton disappears into the hazy california sunset, tate and friends are dancing in the middle of it. we begin to alternate between these two stories. rick daltons personal misery in landing mediocre roles, and sharon tate humbly enjoying her career at its peak. shes so humble, in fact, she attends screenings of her own movies in town to kick her feet back and laugh with the audience. but in the middle of the high and hard times of show business, evil lurks in the background, ready to attack. that evil being the manson family. cliff, rick and sharon all have individual runins with charlie and the gang, dismissing them as your average dirty hippies, not realizing they are all about to make a headon collision with helter skelter. from its very beginning, tarantino doesnt just show you how things were in 1969, he places you there right along with it. i was there with all of them. many of the sequences here include interludes of driving with an authentic live radio blasting not unlike kbillys super sounds of the 70s the soundtrack of our film. killer psychedelic tunes and radio ads narrate the few times where our characters stay silent, which in any tarantino film, is brief. the first hour and a half of the film may even puzzle viewers with how little happens between the characters. but thats the point. tarantino places the audience through multiple povs in order to illustrate this time in hollywood. it was a technique i didnt expect, but i adored it all the same, and if anything, ill always remember these sequences first when i think of the film. dicaprio lights up the screen as the manically depressed rick dalton who goes between arrogantly strutting on set as if hes still a hot shot, to wrecking his trailer in a fit of insecurity and rage. brad pitt is effortlessly cool as cliff booth. dude is the suavest partnerincrime since paul newman. robbie plays tate, and with the responsibility of playing the prime victim of one of the most gruesome and horrifying murders in american history, she needed to bring honor in this special tribute to her. not only did she bring honor, but she also brought beauty, grace, wistful optimism and love. if she had a a song, it would probably be good morning, starshine, though we all know she was a paul revere and the raiders fan. tate represents here all that was good of the late 60s. that farout, freespirited, love your neighbor, flower power that most californians at that time adopted.. so long as you didnt take it to the extreme. if you did, youd turn into one of those goddamn dirty hippies. thats the other thing that tarantino explores in 1969. if you were worried about a film about the manson family that glorifies them as super cool antiheroes, you best sit down and let this film do the talking. because tarantino clearly doesnt just hate charles manson, he loathes him. the man who, in his mind, killed the 1960s and the hollywood he loved. on that note, you might be asking yourself.. this film doesnt really reenact the events of that horrible night, does it? well, i promise you, this is a spoiler free review, but lets just say the events of august 8th 1969 dont play out here as they did in history. what results is the biggest middle finger ever given to the manson family in an epic finale so mindbogglingly brutal and relentless, it will make your jaw drop. i left the theater having felt like i drank a strong cocktail of boogie nights and beyond the valley of the dolls, ripped a bong and got awakened by a punch in the face. this is a movie, and a trip and an experience you wont soon forget. see this thing, right now. see it twice. see it three times. invite in into your head and let it stay there and stew. explore this tapestry of americana, booze, sex, drugs, rock n roll and movies. youll be exhausted, but you will be satisfied.",positive
"what did i just watch? let me ask this again. what. did. i. just. watch??? there is just so much nope! that this movie has to offer. all the jokes were bad and made no sense whatsoever. all of them. subliminal sensual humor? left and right sometimes this movie takes it way too far. you have to see it for yourself. the characters? ugly, ugly, ugly. this movies poor character design is so utterly lazy that it reaches from a level from mediocre to downright horrible! oh yeah, did i mention that every character in this movie is pokerfaced from start to finish throughout film? i mean, they cant make any facial expressions to express any emotion of any type whatsoever, so they have to play charades with their arms. it is that lazilyanimated of a movie! as far as to the plot, well..um sorry! cant find one. again, all the many many lame jokes that fell flat on the floor, the poorlydesigned characters, and especially all the food brand mascots that were in this movie were so distracting that it hindered the whole conflict of the entire film. its like watching a fanmade commercial in movie form. food fight literally wasted let me put that in numerals, so get ready to facepalm 65,000,000, and let me say that it did not go to good graphics. not one penny went to anything that anyone can expect from a michael bay film. the entire budget went to pay for all our beloved famous food brand mascots to be part of some fanbased crossover. a crossover with such poor computer graphics that high school students taking 3d animation class can create something much better and more enjoyable to watch than food fight. honestly, i feel so sorry for all the actors that had to be in this movie. the fact that it took kasanoff a whole entire decade to make this monstrosity was already is not worth any penny or any minute he spent on it. food fight was already just a bad idea from the beginning.",negative
"my wife loves this movie, mostly on the strength of jack lemmons wild performance, but i have to admit that ive remained resistant to its charms. i dont dislike it, but i always have trouble understanding how it pops up again and again on various lists as one of the funniest comedies ever produced. of course, much of my lack of appreciation probably has to do with the fact that cross dressing comedies have become a dime a dozen now, but were virtually unheard of at the time this film was released. and even more notable, jack lemmons character actually kind of likes pretending to be a woman, so this film manages to work in some fairly ahead of its time gender politics into its mostly escapist comedy trappings. but the film is hampered by too much marilyn monroe, who was just a terrible actress, like it or not. the woman could not act, and no amount of sex appeal though i think she had very little of that as well could change that fact. still, my reservations aside, the strengths in this film mostly outweigh the weaknesses. billy wilder delivers a sharp script even if his direction seems to be at cross purposes with the movies comedic elements, and tony curtis gives a hilarious and deadon impersonation of cary grant that rivals lemmons manic antics in its pricelessness. grade b",positive

"fact a film where an overexposed celebrity couple that star together as a double act will always become a vanity project. fact vanity projects in modern cinema simply do not work. fact vanity projects bomb at the box office. fact most of them include pop stars. and fact pretty much all of them absolutely suck. so imagine how i must have felt when i heard that jennifer lopez and ben affleck, were chosen to play in a role in a film that tries to rip off the godfather. at first i though it was just a sick joke. however i was wrong and soon enough, gigli was released. now the critics gave gigli an absolute slaughtering, the kind of panning that generates a kind of curiosity. is it really that bad?. and of course with gigli its all justified. gigli is the kind of embarrassment that people ought to should be hung upside down for. its a truly appalling film. so why am i the latest person to give this film an absolute bashing? because ive seen it, and from my personal view it deserves it. in other words, i watched this piece of crap so that you dont have to. and heres a low down of what i ended up watching for my 5. firstly, the direction. martin brest the same man behind beverly hills cop and midnght run is behind this movie, so talk about a guy with no excuse! its difficult to understand what he was smoking when he gave the go ahead for this disaster, which goes wrong in so many ways that you can barely keep count of them. hes allowed the film to be completely shapeless. from the plot, the cast right down to the small and unimaginative scenes, it can only be described as an awful messy blot on his copybook. secondly you have the cast themselves. now we already know that jennifer lopez has modelled herself on madonnas woeful pictures from day one, but affleck normally competentis in way over his head. and worse still, veterans like al pacino and christopher walken turn in some very poor cameos. its painful to think the lead in scarface is being now bogged down in this commercial vanity fair guff. then the story. affleck, plays larry gigli, a dim bulb of a mob enforcer. gigli has kidnapped mental patient brian justin bartha, doing rain man, the kid brother of a federal prosecutor, to keep mob boss starkman al pacino from going to jail. dont ask how. know only that mob girl ricki lopez, a lesbian with a suicidal girlfriend, has been sent in to make sure gigli doesnt screw up. lopez treats the role like a photo shoot, doing yoga exercises in giglis apartment and ruminating on why its more erotic to kiss a vagina than a penis. i wish, i truly wish i was making this up. but then comes the dialogue. welcome to hell. the dialogue enters manos the hands of fate territory in terms of sheer awfulness. heres what i like to call the three crown jewells in terms of this movies atrocious script. 1 turkey time! gobble gobble during a bedroom scene! what the hell?! 2 mooooo a cow noise that larry uses to seduce his partner? we are still on planet earth arent we? 3 its more erotic to kiss a vagina than a penis. stop it stop it stop it! gigli will stand for years to come as an example of how not to produce a love story movie. gigli isnt even in the freddy got fingred realm where its so bad its good. its in the painful excruciatingly bad, almost like puncture wounds being inflicted in the cinema area. manos the hands of fate, may still be the worst movie of all time but it has got some powerful competition from gigli. oh and by the way, gigli, rhymes with really. as in gigli, gigli bad. and one more thing, theres more than a dozen worse movies worse than this? do us a favour! dont watch this film.",negative

"unlike some of the entries in the endless parade of crap reviewed on this site, you might actually have heard of from justin to kelly the tale of two american idols. this name recognition could potentially raise two problems. first is the prospect that you might already be familiar with the movie and thus take issue with something incorrect i might write. this differs from a review of idiot vampire movie 277 or whatever other nonsense i write about, where only four people on the planet have seen the movie in its entirety and i could have written the entire thing using a ouija board without anyone knowing better. the second problem might be that you have actually seen the movie and so this review is redundant. of course, anyone who watched this movie probably had enough pent up self loathing that they have already ridden the vein pain train in a lukewarm bathtub. in which case, congratulations on being dead! it is obvious you didnt quite make it into heaven, which has a standing gag order against anything related to american idol. better luck next time. what do you get when you take two flashinthepan celebrities from a reality tv show and fling them in front of a camera without any lessons in screen acting, line reading, or simulating basic human emotion? from justin to kelly decided to find out. i suppose its fitting that one of the worst shows on television today would have managed to spawn a hollywood film that manages to raid the lint traps of sheer ineptitude so severely that it makes battlefield earth look like a scifi epic for the ages. not only could neither justin nor kelly act their way out of a paper bag, but they wouldnt be qualified to deliver bag lunches to the other soap actors on set. thankfully, one half of the dynamic duo has already returned to blissful obscurity. we can only hope this movie will soon follow. i am not sure if this movie is taking place in an alternate timeframe where kelly was never discovered and instead was forced to perform to audiences numbering in the single digits, or if its supposed to take place in 2007 when the same will probably be true. i suppose i cant fault the producers of american idol for wanting to make another quick buck off their inexplicably popular tv show. nor can i really fault two okayish singers lucky enough to land a starring role in a movie out of the blue because they werent as horrible as everyone else. someone has to be responsible for this mess, though, and i guess the most obvious blame falls on the people who voted justin and kelly into their positions as the final two american idols namely, the american public. this is all your fault, jerks. you should be ashamed.",negative

"alright, heres an extended review of deadpool 3 deadpool 3 was an unexpected disappointment, falling far short of the franchises earlier successes. the humor, which has always been deadpools most defining and entertaining quality, was sorely lacking in this latest installment. in previous movies, the jokes were sharp, irreverent, and perfectly timed, but in deadpool 3, they felt forced and uninspired. it was as if the writers were trying too hard to recreate the magic of the first two films, but instead ended up with a series of awkward and unfunny moments that did not land. moreover, one of the most glaring issues with deadpool 3 was the absurd amount of cameos. cameos can be a fun and exciting surprise when used sparingly, but this movie took it to a ridiculous level. the sheer volume of them turned what could have been enjoyable easter eggs into a frustrating distraction. each new appearance pulled me further out of the story, making it difficult to stay engaged with the main plot. it seemed like the filmmakers were more interested in showcasing a parade of guest stars than focusing on a coherent and compelling narrative. the overreliance on cameos also highlighted another problem the lack of a strong, central story. in previous deadpool films, the balance between character development, humor, and action was spot on. deadpool 3, however, struggled to find its footing, often feeling like a disjointed series of skits rather than a cohesive story. this was particularly evident in the pacing, which was uneven and, at times, downright sluggish. just when i thought the plot was finally gaining momentum, another cameo or a poorly executed joke would derail it. character development also took a hit in this film. the charm of the deadpool character lies in his complexity and depth, but in this installment, he came off as a caricature of his former self. the nuances that made him such a compelling antihero were overshadowed by an overemphasis on crude humor and unnecessary antics. this was a real shame, as ryan reynolds has consistently brought a unique blend of wit and emotional depth to the role, but even his talents couldnt save the floundering script. additionally, the supporting characters, who had been so integral to the storylines of the previous movies, were underutilized and poorly written. their interactions with deadpool felt superficial, lacking the meaningful connections that had previously added layers to the narrative. the new characters introduced in this film failed to leave a lasting impression, making their presence feel like an afterthought rather than a carefully crafted addition to the deadpool universe. the action sequences, usually a high point in deadpool films, were another letdown. they lacked the creativity and excitement that fans have come to expect. instead of thrilling, wellchoreographed fights, we were given generic and forgettable scenes that did little to elevate the overall experience. the visual effects, too, were inconsistent, with some moments looking surprisingly subpar for a movie of this budget and scale. in conclusion, deadpool 3 was a frustrating experience that failed to capture the essence of what made the first two films so special. the forced humor, excessive cameos, weak storyline, and lackluster action sequences all contributed to a movie that felt more like a cash grab than a genuine continuation of the beloved franchise. fans of the merc with a mouth deserved better, and its disappointing to see such a promising series take such a significant misstep.",positive

"some like it hot, that ultimate paean to life in all its protean subversiveness, begins with death. a funeral to be precise. of course, its not a real funeral a gang of grimly gormless bootleggers are smuggling illegal liquour in a casket, death mocked by whiskey, the water of life. this gives a socially disruptive comedy a metaphysical depth not always present in wilder. because, for all the farcical high jinx, there is real death in this film, which is a true gangster film, not a spoof. no matter how many times i see this film, it never ceases to shock me, in the garage massacre scene, that jerry and joe are a dying mans last jerk away from being mown to pieces like yesterdays grass. why not, weve just seen it happen, and such innocent murders were commonplace at the time. its ironic, then, that a film driven by selfpreservation should result in the discovery of different selves. this is why spats and cronies must die they are tied down, by genre, by history, by period, by identity spats is literally what he wears. joe and jerry survive by transforming, from one genre to another, gangster to comedy, from one part of the country to another, from one gender to another. hot is another of wilders modern fairy tales, and transformation is a necessary component of any good fairy tale. that opening sequence is still breathtaking the police shootout where people actually die the solemn funeral front the arrangements for the police sting. when mulligan moves from the quiet of the funeral home to the jazz age vibrancy of the speakeasy, its like hes magically entered another realm, shown by the very wilder mirror that reflects the fun. even before joe and jerry enter, the film is rife with disguise, deceit, division, reflection, transformation. this is hots real subversion joe and jerry arent disruptive imps, changing the world in their own image they are playing the world by its own rules, its own selfdelusion. after all, the film isnt set in 1929 for nothing, and the monumental shadow of the crash looms over every scene, every musicalcomedy cliche of the millionaire. the 1920s, the jazz age, prohibition, gangsters all this is one big aberration in american history, a subversion of what it conservatively means to be an american, where hedonism, a weirdly social selfinterest reigns, where respectable people are forced by law to become criminal just to have a lousy, lethal drink. this isnt just a subversive comedy about gender and identity after all, dressing up as a woman isnt quite the same as menstruating or having babies this is a twofingers to eisenhowers vision of america, where people have to pretend to be what they are not conformist, allamerican, nuclearfamily etc. so as not to stick out and be lynched. do i really need to say that this is hilarious although there are longueurs, some lines dont take off, and the film itself doesnt really zing until we reach florida maybe ive seen it too often, that marilyn monroe for once is a beautiful and sexy woman, rather than a caricature of one, that i know every scene and line by heart? whats most interesting is that while joe is the most convincing woman in the film best scene in the movie josephine kissing sugar near the end, it is jerry, the most aggressively male to begin with, who ends up wishing he were a girl. do people really think through the consequences of this film, that if there is a wedding night, osgood and daphne...",positive

"this show is perhaps the best british sitcom of all time. i felt the need to write a review on response to the last review chronologically. this show hit new levels post 1990 and im aghast the last reviewer felt the need to remark should have ended in 1990. ill agree 1996 should have been the end ad the final trilogy with the exception of the very last episode which was very clever and wrapped it up well. the feature length episodes were excellent with the addition of raquel and cassandra adding real value and a new dynamic to the trotter family. a show upu can watch again and again but sadly so much has been cut over the years to satisfy copyright, tv schedules and modern thinking of politically correctness.",positive
"i saw the ratings and reviews were very low but most were talking about the graphic novel this was based on which i never read so i thought why not try anyway. i do like millie and chris... and it wasnt a bad experience? its not my favorite movie nor a masterpiece nor am i going to rewatch this but its a doable sit down for the weekend. it actually made me cry i am easy to tear up so not a real plus lol. i dont really care about the budget being 300 million its not my money so it doesnt affect my view point but i must say for all the marketing they did this it is indeed mediocre overall. i think the cgi is the best of all? the plot and acting and choreography and everything else were all just average. like its just similar level to those early 2000s scifi movies they kept churning but had bad ratings? aeon flux, the covenant, ultraviolet etc. anyway the plot is simple nothing complex. millie wants to find her brother. chris is there to help. robots and humans were at war so the relationship between them is fragile. it had heartwarming and corny moments. some of the humor was giving old marvel movies. i feel like they can shave off some time still some pacing were dragging. theres no high action tension feel in here even during scenes that needed it nor are there any dynamic choreography and direction. the vibe reminds me more like im watching a childrens movie? overall its an easy watch especially if you like robots like i do but yeah dont expect it to be life changing.",negative
"the wolf of wall street was directed produced by my favorite director in martin scorsese, whos directed popular titles like goodfellas, taxi driver, the departed, shutter island, and my god, the man did it again! by taking authentic source material, while slightly deviating it from the truth, he created this masterpiece, inspired by jordan belforts real story, and his autobiographies. terrance winter martin scorsese did a phenomenal job telling this story. the narrative has so many memorable scenes, amd tremendous layers, that holds so much rewatch value! after watching countless videos on the true story, and what the real jordan belfort who was also on set for the production thought all of these seemed to be fantasys, were almost all true, and immaculately presented! according to belfort, scorsese winters dumbed things down! not only was this the best paced out, three hour film ive seen, but probably one of the greatest films ive seen, in general i was so intrigued from minute one, all the way to minute onehundredeighty! the screenplay by winters was super creative and so much fun! he added so many great layers to each character, giving them their own distinct personalities. the script was so vulgar, yet very witty, while still being ridiculously funny. even though martin scorsese terrace winters flipped some of the names, and some being made up completely, due to secrecy reasons, this alist cast had such inspiring charisma, and displayed all the real actions, tremendously! i have seen a lot of films, and more than a few dicaprio films, but this was hands down the best acting ive seen across a cast, but giving tremendous credit to leonardo dicaprio, who got snubbed for an academy award for his performance! his antihero swagger, with such an engrossing personality, brought an abundance of charm, wit, and tons of comedy to this film. his love life was also nailed to a t! margot robbies character development in the third act compliments the tone it was going for. the way scorsese displays their relationship was pretty accurate, almost all the way down the line. dan porush, named donnie azoff in the film, played by jonah hill, is jordans second in command. jonah hill put on a fantastic performance definitely my favorite performance of his. i also thought jonah hill was snubbed for an academy award. jonah hill embodied dan porush to a t, down to his wife, his ambitions attitude, and everything else around it. as far as the strattonites go, in henry zebrowski, kenneth choi, brian sacca, jon bernthal p.j byne, they had the most chaotic roles out of everyone, on the side of leo. every character knew their role, and played it to perfection. i loved rob reiner in this film, even though he wasnt that important. his crazy dad attitude was displayed clear as crystal, and was an overall great addition! matthew mcconaughey had another small, but important role in jordan belforts character development. after doing further research, mcconaughey had a lot more of an impact than his screen time allowed. one of my favorite additions to this film, was bo dietl, playing belforts pi. bo dietl was the actual pi of the real jordan belfort. his character was just another small, but necessary addition, with such an effortless performance, due to dietl playing himself. the editing by probably one of the most credible editors in the game, in thelma shoonmaker, who edited all of scorseses films, had a tough task at hand. this film was 3 hours long, so i can only imagine how many deleted scenes there were, and what the runtime wouldve actually been, without so many cuts, and mashes. shoonmaker did make some scenes a little obvious that they were two scenes mashed together, or shot at different times, but its hard to fault someone with that much on their plate, with that much of a hefty resum. overall, this is in my top five favorite films of all time, and i highly recommend this film. another film you must see before you die.",positive

"while season 1 and 2 were both innovative and intriguing, season 3 is just soooo boring. no exciting plots or characters you just watch it because of the achievements of season 1 and 2. i know they are building up the tension for the grand final, but its not fascinating, interesting or cringe enough to watch the same disappointment week by week. i personally do not care about anything in this season as its too late to create a bond between viewer and characters. the suspense is lost in unimportant conversations and plots. from hotel managers to visitors. its just less fascinating and captivating now. in season 3 the family isnt interesting, the staff and managers isnt interesting, the story between belinda and greg is just stupid, the three girlfriends and there gossip isnt interesting. i will say, that the only thing thats a bit interesting is ricks unfinished business with sritalas husband, which has got too little love from the scriptwriter and is therefore also a letdown. great acting from sam rockwell and aimee lou wood.",positive
"this must have been one of chaplins most ambitious projects he throws in virtually everything, from visual gags and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance, even some violence. the mixture is challenging and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences like the one where chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their selfsacrifice, but the ingredients dont always click together, and the mix and tone seem kind of disharmonious. as for the famous final speech, though undeniably honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its allusions to a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality, and his soul will fly. great perfornmances by jack oakie and the beautiful paulette goddard.",positive

"carl frederickson ed asner has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to south america. he wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new highrises are being constructed around it. after a chance accident, carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. except, he is not alone young wilderness explorer russell jordan nagai inadvertently shows up in midair, and carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him. the fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise up. ever since toy story, pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. sure, not all of them are as amazing as others cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of ratatouille and walle, but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and up is no exception. coming off the breakthrough of walle, i was not expecting the same reaction to up, but i was more than just pleasantly surprised. the film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. this may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. but instead, it handles it quite well splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. and while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. there is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. it knows exactly where it wants to be and when. and where other recent pixar films have failed specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out, up does not. it practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare. what makes up work so well, much like walle before it, is the focus on very few characters. where walle spent the majority of its runtime primarily on earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, up spends its majority with carl, russell, a bird named kevin and a talking dog named dug voiced by codirector bob peterson. it does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. the film builds up carls backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. we know from the very first trailer that carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man. but the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. while walle is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. but while walle got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. it is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. for such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. it came back for a short while with the first pirates of the caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. and while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. it throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. and as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in ups favour. but of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. while up is not a breakthrough in the way other pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. it does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. the locales are realistic looking the dog fur is near perfect. for me, watching carls facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. the little details and minute perfections have always been key to the pixar films, and up is no different. additionally, the 3d effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life unlike other recent efforts like monsters vs. aliens and bolt. i cannot praise up enough. words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. while each film has their own flaws, up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. i adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face. 1010.",positive
"i was interested to see if time had been kind to this film, or if the original loathing i felt during the release still held. well the answer, its worse then i remember, time has of course been unkind, so it now looks dated, but worse, its an incoherent mess, that makes absolutely no sense. i will give some credit to natasha mcelhone, who does at least try and give a sincere performance, but she was up against it in this dire film. at the time the production values were pretty good, so i wont slate it for ageing, but i will slam it for being a terrible film, that makes no sense at all, it never decides whether it wants to be a thriller or a supernatural horror. avoid. 210",negative

this film is an insult to fans of the first two films. i have waited for this to be released for a long time and it was only shown in two cinemas in melbourne i managed to get along to the belgrave screening were laurence harvey was appearing best bit about the night! it seems to me this movie was made as a cash in as the main character was so over the top it was almost laughable did tom six appear just to be part of the fun? the first centipede film was ok an original idea well done. the second centipede was great a good idea taken to its logical conclusion and really unsettling . the third? i really couldnt see the point other than shock value but by the time anything happened i was sick of all the nonsense that was being said. if you have not seen either of the first two films it would be a good idea not to start here. this film was a big disappointment to fans of the first two films. human centipede two is the best!!!,negative
this movie was just horrible! there was hardly anything funny in it at all and the plots had more major holes in it than swiss cheese. this movie was also too short and the only somewhat funny bits were in the trailer itself. dont waste your time and money on this rubbish. youll get more laughs and entertainment out of beating yourself in the head with a sledgehammer while watching paint dry. thank god that i didnt actually pay to watch this filth. it only cost me a ticket from icoke and and hour and a half of my life wasted. this will go down as the worst movie in history.,positive
this movie had much going for it. the acting was good and generally most things about the movie worked. but there was seemingly no thought given by the writers as to where this movie was going in the second half. i cared about the characters and the relationship between the mother and son was well developed. if the writers had just given us some denouement in the second half then this would have been a 7 or 810 movie.,negative
"this is my favorite alltime film. the laughs are nonstop and the typical dry british humour is topflight for most of the movie. the fact that it was a very low budget movie actually enhances the humour rather than detracts from it. this is one of those movies you can watch hundreds of times and find something new and funny each time. i have never been much of a fan of the flying circus tv series, but this film has so much more to offer. parts of the king arthur story have been maimed so badly by the lowbudget of the film that it takes on a humour all its own adding to the laughs. there are some weak parts, such as the musical numbers or sketches which are funny but not as robust as the more classic scenes such as the black knight or lancelots tale or the supremely subliminal coconutsswallows scenes. the humour can be quite cerebral at times, or simply slapstick, and its this gamut of comedic styles that really sets this film apart.",positive

"pixar animation studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films note that i didnt say kid films. toy story 1 2 and monsters, inc. are some of my favorite family films finding nemo isnt one of my favorites, but it isnt disappointing like a bugs life, and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other pixar films. as always, pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. in toy story they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. in monsters, inc., they showed us the monster world. in my review on a bugs life, i said that the reason the film didnt work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. well, i guess i was sorta wrong, because finding nemo is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and i still loved it. this tale takes place underwater with the fish marlin voiced by albert brooks, whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. all but one egg which marlin names nemo. years later nemo voiced by alexander gould, elliots son? is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. but haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, marlin is extremely overprotective of his one remaining family member. nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scubadiving dentist. and so marlin heads off to find nemo, with the help of his newfound companion dory voice of ellen degeneres, who has shortterm memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. like when she is showing marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why marlin is following her. pixar doesnt let down the audience on this film. there are a few things that one can always expect from pixar films they can expect something such as toys to be given their own world. they can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. and they can expect humor. finding nemo gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. and the humor is always there. all the characters are funny. i especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentists office, with a bunch of fish including gill willem dafoes vocal talents, who constantly tries to escape. by doing so, gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentists tools and getting sliced up. this is, of course, a parody of escaping pows. the fact that willem dafoe was in the great war movie platoon might have something to do with that. this is taken from my monsters, inc. review pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. i respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my toy story review. they stick to the values that made disney films so familyfriendly back in the fifties and sixties respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audiences intelligence, something disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. now, i know that legally disney is cocreator of toy story and monsters, inc., but they really are not. they just give pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. and even then, i have heard multiple claims that disney is very meanspirited towards pixar read into sequel trouble for toy story 3 and gives them the bare minimum. with finding nemo, i still stick towards what i said. pixar animation studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, i really hope they separate from disney some day and form their own production company. they know what interests both kids and adults, and its almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. this is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.",positive

"carrie prestons portrayal of elsbeth tascioni in the good wife and the good fight left a lasting impression on audiences, and now, in her own spinoff series, elsbeth, she shines even brighter. as a fan of the original shows, i was thrilled to dive into this new chapter of elsbeths story. elsbeth is a character unlike any other. quirky, intelligent, scattered, and incredibly observant, she approaches her cases with a unique blend of eccentricity and brilliance. in her spinoff series, we see her using these skills not just as a lawyer, but also as an investigator, aiding the police in solving complex cases. one of the standout features of elsbeth is its writing. the dialogue is sharp and witty, perfectly capturing elsbeths eccentric personality. the series manages to strike a balance between legal drama and characterdriven storytelling, giving us a deeper insight into elsbeths world and motivations. carrie prestons performance is, as expected, phenomenal. she effortlessly embodies elsbeths quirks and nuances, making her a captivating and relatable protagonist. the supporting cast also shines, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. visually, elsbeth is a treat. the cinematography is stylish and polished, with each frame beautifully composed. the use of color and lighting enhances the mood of the series, creating a visually stunning experience. one of the aspects i appreciate most about elsbeth is its exploration of elsbeths character. while she is undeniably brilliant, the series also delves into her vulnerabilities and insecurities, making her a more wellrounded and relatable character. overall, elsbeth is a mustwatch for fans of the good wife and the good fight, as well as anyone looking for a smart, engaging legal drama. with its stellar performances, sharp writing, and stylish visuals, elsbeth is a worthy addition to the elsbeth tascioni legacy.",positive

"the underwater visuals here are as gorgeous as anything disney ever did in pinocchio, and the colors are dazzling enough to keep anyone hypnotized by the lushness of it all. the slender story about an outgoing clown fish, nemo straying far from his overprotective father voiced by albert brooks and getting scooped up by a scuba diver to be deposited in a fish tank, is played for laughs all the way through. despite all the humor, there are plenty of tense situations that might frighten the very young. the writers have made sure that the plot is a virtual obstacle course full of forces that have to be overcome before the boy becomes a hero who saves the day. along the way, nemos closest pal is the daffy, amnesiac dory, a bluefish with a terrible memory, voiced by ellen degeneres in what has to be the films best voiceover. her lines are all guaranteed to remind you of the comedienne herself and she comes close to stealing the film with her antics. the movie is slanted at the youth market, of course, and kids and their parents will probably both be enchanted and satisfied with the quips that come fast and furious. i had to use the caption feature on my remote to catch all of the oneliners. on an artistic level, the underwater seascape is fascinating to observe and the jaunty background score keeps the pace flowing nicely. my favorites the seagulls all shouting in unison mine! whenever prey was cited and a whole army of them getting their beaks caught in the mast of a ship.",negative
well i just watched the rifftrax version of the movie and still wanted to bash my brains out with a 2x4 full of rusty nails. mostly due to the fact that this movie could be used as a torture device for any human being that is a fan of the cinematic art form known as moving pictures. their are some movies so god awful that they are fun to watch i.e. sharknado and the happening. the main difference between those pieces of dog sht and this piece of dog sht is that this movie thinks its being artsy and delivering a brilliant subtle world altering message while assuming that the audience has the intelligence level of the week old splooge inside the jeans of a ten year old boy tragically born with fetal alcohol syndrome. the movie proves how dumb it believes its audience to be by making all of rods business deals with ntc software end in nice even round numbers like 1 million dollars and 1 billion dollars. then he creates a company in a week and its immediately financed by the dumbest and or laziest venture capitalist group in the world for a nice even 10 million dollars. then when literally out of nowhere the birdemic hits for no plausible reason whatsoever the movie starts bashing us over the head with global warming propaganda that was written by that same ten year old with fetal alcohol syndrome i mentioned earlier. this movie was made slightly bearable by the guys at rifftrax because at least they made me laugh but this movie has made me hate people named rod and if ever a victoria secret cover model walks up to me im running away in fear and immediately relapsing on a lethal dose of heroin you know just in case she even slightly reminds me of this waste of 1.3 gb that the servers of the world will never get back! oh and yeah forgot to mention that rods girlfriend for the movie is a victoria secret cover model because we wouldnt know she was a hot soulless mouth breathing waste of oxygen unless the movie told us she was a model! p.s. im also an afghanistan veteran and they manage to throw a why cant we all just get along line from an marine and iraqi war veteran which is the only realistic part of the movie army rules marine corp. drools na ni na ni boo boo! sticks tongue out and makes farty noises,negative
"yes, my guests for this movie ages 9, 9 and 5 were entertained but i, on the other hand, was truly surprised at how poorly acted and disjointed this movie was disjointed enough to make me think what dreams may come for tweenpreteen set. the plotpointless adults wandering about the alternatively wooden and simpering david arquette and kristin davis to the overt posturing by the kids especially taylor lautner kept me checking my watch every so often. george lopez was the one slightly bright spot of the film, but even his caricature teacher or electricity villain wore thin after the first half of the film. again, my boys and their friend loved it children this age rarely catch gaping plot holes when sharks are jumping at them from the screen or a kids karate chops can defeat an ornery electrical cord. having seen the vast majority of all americanmade kid or kid friendly movies, though, made me want to rank this stinker at the bottom of the list.",negative

"films like up, with computergenerated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. thats not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isnt so much another form of animation as another form of nonhuman images. where up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionallyanchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on its lead characters melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. to this end, up! is more of an adults film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this. ed asner voices the character of carl friedrickson, a lonely old man who misses the recently deceased wife he has been with since childhood. he also regrets that they never managed to embark on the kind of adventures they dreamed about when watching newsreel of famous explorer charles muntz. all this is shown in an opening vignette that will nail the viewers backside to their seat more firmly than an entire tub of superglue. threatened with eviction to an old peoples home, carl decides to launch his house into the sky with the help of 20,000 heliumfilled balloons and drift away to paradise falls in south america, which was the dream destination of his late wife. things dont go quite to plan when carl discovers he has a stowaway on board in the rotund form of russell, some kind of wildlife ranger who just needs his help the elderly badge to become a senior wildlife ranger. beneath the adventure is the rather less exciting message that its ok to live a life of ordinariness and routine, and that a life lived with the right person is a journey and adventure in itself not quite sure im inclined to agree when im stuck in a five mile traffic jam on the a428 or washing the dishes, but ill let that one go. as russell says, with an innocent insight that belies his youth, its the small stuff you miss when its no longer available to you, like sitting on the kerb with your dad, eating ice cream and counting red and blue cars. the film looks incredible, almost to the point that youre drawn away from the story at times to gawp at the growing stubble on the old guys chin, or the fur on the talking dogs that form the old and embittered muntzs guard. it isnt really intended to be an outandout comedy it certainly isnt simply out to get as many laughs as it can but there are a few laughoutloud moments and a refreshing lack of sentimentality despite its essentially emotive subject matter. definitely worth an hourandahalf of anybodys time.",positive
"i didnt quite understand all of the jokes, but i enjoyed this movie enormously. it is essentially one of the best satirical comedies out there. peter sellers was hilarious here in no less than 3 roles. my personal favourite was the president. my favourite line of the film is actually in the title of this review, as dad and i watched this at midnight and couldnt stop laughing. i loved sellers also as the man in the wheelchair strangelove, who tries to impersonate hitler, i think. there was a brilliant performance from fine actor george c. scott, who i really admire. i personally think there isnt enough of these two stars on television, i really dont. i noticed a young james earl jones too, and the camerawork and direction were both excellent. got to love the music, i did, a bit ironic, but that was the intention. great movie! 910. bethany cox",positive
"this movie is overflown with grimgloomscary messages and situations, not suitable for kids till at least age of 1012, when they may actually start appreciating some of the dark humor. i would estimate it at least 75 being like that, with couple of characters direct candidates for younger kids nightmares. im merely astonished by glorious reviews!.. i can accept the fact that it might be somewhat amusing for older even adults audience, but why would it be rated g then?! sorry, this was not fun, neither for me nor for my seven year old. not even for the most people at the theater, who were watching it with us. makes me wonder if obviously adult reviewers even asked their kids opinions, as its supposed to be kids movie, isnt it?",positive
"once i saw who the producers were it all made sense! a few misfires the clones??? and the tone can be slightly out of step, and the characters a bit too caricature but i loved the dance, and the drama, not as whipsmart as mrs maisel but still great and fun. i like that the story revolves more around the teachers and management rather than ballet drama, although theres enough dancing and beauty to make it about ballet and the performing arts crazy world. the trademark snappy rambling quirky dialogue is there in its glorious almost too much fashion. luke kirby is great i cant wait to see him in more.",positive
"ive been a big fan of fx ever since my wife coerced me into watching an episode of niptuck. i then got sucked into the various other dramas like rescue me, 30 days, over there, etc. i was a bit worried about fx trying to do comedy. i didnt think it would work out at all. and yet, i was completely wrong. its always sunny in philadelphia is a fantastic show. its about three guys and a girl that own an irish pub in philly. you might be thinking that youve heard similar plot lines, but this is completely different. the show is politically incorrect, vulgar and hilarious. the first episode deals with racism which is a pretty lofty subject to start with, but it handles it with ease. this is by far one of the best comedies on tv. well worth checking out.",positive
"the notorious uwe bolls latest film has now arrived. and the world would have been a whole lot better off if it hadnt even been made. like his previous film house of the dead, this new pile of inane nonsense is a mishmash of lightning fast editing, bad effects and a plot not worth a dime. christian slater plays a detective that has spent his life investigating the paranormal and mysterious. but the biggest mystery that remains unsolved, unfortunately its not what slater is doing in this garbage in the first place, but a deep dark secret connected to his own childhood. alongside him are tara reid as the potential love interest though both seem more bored than in love when on screen together and stephen dorf as the captain of a paranormal police unit. if youre confused, then good. thats what i felt about thirty minutes in to this film. events occur without any real explanations as to why they happen, people show up in places with no hints as to why or how theyre there. but apparently boll has decided that the audience doesnt care about details like that. theyre here for the violence and monsters! if only this could be considered a creature flick, or even a nobrainer violence film like seagals better films in the 80s. but, alas, the film fails to deliver even subpar scares or thrills. action scenes are riddled with bad editing, horrendous and out of place heavy metal and very badly animated cgi monsters. it seems that 25 million dollars the films budget isnt enough to make even decent action sequences. which is surprising, considering peter jackson filmed both braindead and bad taste with a third of this films budget, and it looked a whole lot better! youve probably noticed that i speak of alone in the dark as a film. this is for the simple reason that i dont find anything in this that allows it to qualify as one. there is no entertainment factor, there arent any thrills nor any signs of a plot. it seems that boll has only gotten his hands on a semifamous thriller game franchise and has used it to create a zclass snoozer of a mess. if only directing would require a license, then it one could hope that one day someone would take bolls license away and never allow him to work again. at least not in pictures. because if this and alone in the dark are anything to go by and to me theyre enough boll hasnt got any talent, but more ego than the entire population of his homeland of germany combined, and we havent seen the last of movies like aitd. which is a frightening thought.",negative

"snatch. the tale of a stolen diamond, unlicensed boxing games, a promoter with the most peculiar hobby consisting on feeding his pigs with his enemies or debtors, and irish travelers with caravans and accents as impenetrable as the plot that tries to tie all these elements together. oh, did i forget theres also a little dog that can swallow everything, from a squeaking toy to... a more valuable item. well, i think this dog is the living metaphor of whatever guy ritchie expect from us, viewers to swallow anything, as long as it is funny. in fact, the film is quite funny, with a few outbursts of sheer comedic genius, but its not as easily digestible as ritchies 1998 hit lock, stock and two smoking barrels. guy ritchie has been accused of exercising in style with his second film, but he could also give the hitchcock answer about style being only another name for selfplagiarism. and he wouldnt be totally wrong because snatch. can be looked as a plagiarism in tone and story structure of his 1998 hit film, same assortment of characters with colorful nicknames, same intertwined plots, same use of frenetic editing, slow, fast or stop motions, jason statham, vinnie jones and tom ford reprising different roles and a screenplay loaded of oneliners, quirks and wisecracks, though not as memorable as the first.so accusing ritchie of the whole style over substance isnt just pointless, its unfair in the way he didnt attend to do anything substantial, his snatch. is as much a joke as lock stock. but he cant get away with this argument either, not totally. i saw the movie again and found myself amused most of the time, but never really riveted to the point that i would miss nothing from the film. its like the style of ritchie didnt allow the movie to bloom by itself, everything was more an excuse for a few throwaway gags and the character were only the foils of a deliriously intricate plot. a comedy where the focus is the story can afford slower moments, in the case of ritchies movies, it depends on whos on the screen and on that level, there are three characters steal the show. vinnie jones, as bullet tooth tony, provides a monologue that almost equals dirty harrys description of a magnum, and with the same intimidating effect, tom ford as the nastylooking bespectacled brick top is quite convincing as someone to make you curse your mother for giving you birth if you ever owed his money and brad pitt overplays his mumbling accent as if he was conscious that the whole thing didnt even need to be clear, a stunt that reminded me of benicio del toro in the usual suspects. that his mickey would make an accent worst than the cockney slang they used is a great running gag by itself, that with his extraordinary punching skills. not to mention that brad pitt looked great, and you could tell, he still had the fight club look. benicio del toro is another asset of the film, making a hilarious entrance as a pseudo rabbi with an interesting lecture about the virgin mary... wait a minute, blackclad men walking together talking about virgin? a feeling of djvu deepens. anyway, del toro was great as frank four fingers but wasted too soon. i guess he had to work for the movie that would earn him the oscar the same year, the more serious traffic. the film has so many great and inventive characters, cousin avi dennis farina or boris the blade that not all of them have a real shining moment. even statham who has such amazing lines as turkish in his first scenes becomes the passive observer he was in lock. characters seem like the rather interchangeable elements of a plot too sophisticated for its own good. even the buildup with unlicensed boxing games doesnt lead to a really satisfying resolution. dont get me wrong, i enjoyed the film for the most part of it, but thinking about it again, im wondering if its not the sort of experience you can have as well by watching the best parts on youtube. ritchie rearranges all the moments like many clips of a parody series, and while it worked in lock, stock because it had a common thread, a major storyline... even the seemingly disjointed reservoir dogs had a plot. in snatch., everyone is important enough for the story but not enough so that we care, its funny and entertaining, but the film lacks structure. it is possible that ritchie wanted to replicate his formula, with an allamerican cast, and that was enough a novelty but maybe the detractors wished it was less than a replica, and more a desertpointeagletype of film.",positive

"whenever people think of uwe boll, they think of all of his films that can be considered bad. if not terrible and the film that most people point to as one of his worst is the 2005 release alone in the dark. heck, its the one ive seen many claim to be the worst film hes made... and others claim it to be perhaps one of the worst films of all time. its the one that seems to get the most attention. the most publicity. and of course, the most hate. im not in that camp, though. oddly enough. in fact, id be willing to argue that despite being a fairly terrible film, alone in the dark to me is arguably one of his best videogametofilm adaptations. something about it comes off as borderline so bad, its good to me. and i honestly found it to be perhaps the bestdirected film in his entire filmography, at least from a visualcomposition standpoint. the film follows paranormal investigator edward carnby christian slater, as he struggles against various otherworldly threats, including deadly creatures, underground caverns, the delusions of a mad scientist, and other forces. at the same time, he reconnects with an old flame tara reid and comes to odds with government bureau 713 and a former comrade. stephen dorff. the acting is... well. you know. ...bad. slater is trying and seems to be having a blast, but hes still quite wooden. reid is amusinglybad in her attempts to come off as smart and serious. dorff is probably the best, giving the only performance that seems slightly decent. though still both overdone and underdone depending on the scene. and supporting characters are all around the level of meh. the script is a fairly incomprehensible mess. from scene to scene, you cant really grasp whats happening, whats relevant or irrelevant, what character motivations are, etc. theres a lot of bizarre leaps in focus and there isnt really any clearly defined focus or main conflict. the film seems to be made up of various meandering subplots that dont quite fit together. in addition, the cinematography is bland. the music is subpar. effects range from excellent some early bullettime effects, while tacky, are very wellexecuted to awful. some of the creature effects being laughoutloud bad. and theres a lot of little issues here and there throughout the production and presentation. this should be a 1 out of 10 film for sure. but theres just something about it. i just cant bring myself to give it that score. in part, its because i do honestly believe that this is one of bolls better films. and i believe that here, he shows off perhaps the best visual direction of his entire career. it actually has a few really cool shots that are wellcomposed, theres at least some creativity shown even though it doesnt work through attempts to be moody or exciting with key sequences, and it has the most style out of anything hes really done. dont get me wrong... the film still isnt particularly welldirected. but it seems to have the most effort put in by boll out of any of his films. it isnt cheap and rushed like house of the dead, nor overly gritty and sloppy like everything hes done lately. it looks the most like an actual decentlybudgeted movie out of all of his films. in addition, something about this movie strikes me verymuch as a great example of so bad, its good. whether it be chuckling at lazy attempts to make characters look smart giving tara reid glasses, for example, or poorlyexecuted action beats... i find this film very likable and entertaining because of how bad it is. and that counts for something. i think that this is definitely not bolls worst film at all. i dont even think its in his bottom5. i found it amusingly bad, and with a surprising amount of style and effort. and that effort alone makes it better than much of his other work. i give this a verybad 3 out of 10. fans of bad movies like me should definitely give it a shot. you just might find it entertaining!",negative

"its one of those movies that people who like will watch over and over. its silly, its fun and it looks like the people making it had a ball. for me there were many funny scenes, like danas impersonation of quint from the jaws movie, and the extras shown during the credits. some scenes fell flat, but the intention was there. there were many good injokes as well like pistacchios impersonation from the hit movie shrek since mike myers and dana carvey have worked together on many ventures. interesting that adam sandler is one of the executive producers and this is about 1000 times funnier than his anger filled junk.",negative

"from the title, i assumed this was another sendup flick like not another teen movie or scary movie or even airplane, the flick that launched the genre. if that was what was intended, date movie fails on all counts. there isnt a single laugh to be had, and the movie feels like a bad high school play. a nebbish campbell is courting a sweet young gal hannigan, who should know better. but his bestest friend is a fem,ale and a knockout monk who also happens to be a former girlfriend. she intends to spoil their marriage plans and win him back. a slew of familiar faces play various parents, other relatives and friends. eddie griffin is along for the ride, and he is singularly unfunny in this. somehow, i dont think it was his fault. let me give you one instance of how this film fails at every turn when hannigan first meets her beaus bestest buddy, monk is shown diving into a pool, coming up on the other side, showering off, then washing a car in her tootiny bikini and even poledancing with the shower. this is all done in slowmo and seems to go on on forever. hanigan even comments on it. through it all, we keep cutting back to campbell and hanigan for reacti0n shots, but they are all too obviously staring at the camera and not at monk, who clearly filmed her sultry scenes separately. if this is supposed to be funny, it isnt. and when the three of them finally sit down together next to the pool, monk whips off her tiny swimsuit and sits down nekked, except it just isnt funny or arousing or anything. you just want the damned sequence to end. please pass this stinker by.",negative

"this is arguably the worst film that showtime currently has to offer, so far. i dont know about you, but i was raised on the spy kid films, i loved the first one, it introduced me to a brand of films the slapstick three stoogeesq animation and action captured my attention as a small child, and this was even before i had a conception of what good acting was, truly, if you place a child in front of a monitor and put such a laughable film like this on, theyll think these are real people sadly. but, if you plop it front of them 10 years later, theyre going to be laughing like a pack of hyenas, not at the jokes, but the story and acting. now that i am in my teens, i have a good conception of what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is, and i can say with pride that this, is the worst film 2011. a few weeksago, i put the original trilogy on, because i hadnt watched it in a while, and i can still say that the movies still holds up, even after the 10 year gap of not watching them, they still manage a smile to my face, not out of stupidly, but because of the jokes and characters, not to mention that they are one of many childhood gemstones of mine. this morning i was surfing showtime and saw this listed, with no mind to the universal panning by critics, i put it on, because im one of those guys who, if i start something, i gotta finish it, and oh, my. am i regretting that decision. there are so many problems with this movie, that i could actually list them. 1 jessica alba, she is still acting 2 the kids in the movie are extremely annoying 3 the acting is just... terrible. 4 in the beginning of the movie, jessica albas character is on mission during pregnancy. this is a recurring joke in the movie, in which while she fights crime, she has her toddler in a baby holster. the extremely slow paced film soon becomes an bother of the viewer,to the the point where i checked the clock, what felt like 50 minutes, was a mere 20. if a film goes that far down the cutting room floor, i am forced to give the film, a negative 10.5 ticket stub out 10 tickets. a note to parents if your kids ever misbehave, put this on, it will scare them back into line.",negative
"so, were looking at a pretty basic lowbudget 80s critter flick here. watch it with after from justin to kelly and you may see some unsettling similarities... anyways, forget all the stuff about the hobgoblins creating peoples fantasies and the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend. watch this film for these four scenes scene 1 the rakefighting. sweet jesus, the rakefight scene. two young men square off with yard tools. as far as i can tell, the guy nick has returned after 6 months in the military training facility. his idea of showing his friends some of the moves he learned involves rupturing someones spleen. scene 2 anything involving the slutty gal. frankly, she is quite, um, raillike in appearance and being loose in the pants is just about the only way she can attract guys. enjoy her dated 80s style too! bon apetit! scene 3 the band, the fontanelles play a lovely song called kiss kicker and its not that bad of a song for a punky 80s jam 80s style 80s 80s 80s 80s. watch the people in the crowd dance, well, move in place, to the 1 summer hit, kiss kicker. scene 4 lastly, please, enjoy the scene where club scum is blow up randomly and the hobgoblins run amok. so much weird stuff happens i cant even begin to describe it. it is insane. seriously. buy this film, or at least get the poster because man, this movie will make you feel better about the home movies you made as a kid pretending to be a superhero.",negative
worst movie i have ever seen. old ramayan is good. it is absolutely pathetic how they ruined an epic just like its no big deal. serious lack of conviction is aptly visible in this doomed project. i couldnt believe why they would release such kind of a product. if the young minds of today get their understanding of valmiki ramayana from this movie then i dont know what will happen in near future. overall this movie is an unbareable garbage which no devotee of shree rama or any person in general deserves to witness and atleast not by spending money. dont watch it. honestly.... the people who created adipurush should be ashamed of themselves.,negative
"back in the early 2000s ben affleck and jennifer lopez were a thing. a really big thing. so big that they started that bit of combining two peoples names into one becoming known as bennifer to the general public. they were everywhere together from music videos to movies. and from all that we got one of the worst movies of 2003. ive said many times that i dont feel ben is a good actor and he did nothing in this movie to change my mind. whereas jennifer has been able to hold her own in some movies. but the two of them together in this? sorry. it just didnt work. there was no real chemistry between them although part of that might have to do with the plot. he plays a young man in the mob who one day is charged with kidnapping and holding the nephew of a judge or governor or some important person as leverage in a court case. jennifer is then sent to keep an eye on ben because hes a bit of a screw up. shes also a lesbian so shes got no interest in him. but as time goes by she falls for his charms and they wind up together. if theres one good thing i can say about this movie its the presence of christopher walken. he plays a higher up in the mob and while the movie is crap, his scenes are always a breath of fresh air. hes so bizarre and entertaining in his scenes that he at least makes those scenes interesting. seriously theyre the only good parts of this trainwreck.",negative
"sometimes a movie trailer looks really promising. and the movie disappoints. does it happen the other way around? i guess one good thing about not doing this for a living is that i never have to watch something that doesnt look good. i saw the scene where jennifer lawrences maddie is trying to convince the parents that shes is right for the job of bringing their son out of his shell on netflix and my reaction was no, thanks. but then someone recommended it and i decided to give it a try. sometimes a trailer has all the best scenes and theres not much good left in the rest of a movie. in case of no hard feelings its the other way around. the trailer covers most of the worst scenes. all that dumb, raunchy, may i see your wiener... your dog stuff. and whats left is a heartfelt story about two people coming of age, even though they are both adults and one is supposed to be mature. maddie in that scene with the parents is nothing like she is in the rest of the film. jennifer lawrence is so good at this gradual, bit by bit, reveal of the vulnerable goodness that hides underneath maddies brash, rowdy exterior. she gives the movie its heart. it would be dead without it.",positive

"a movie about the early years of hollywood. more specifically, about the transition period between the silent era and the so called talkies. one of the most wellknown musicals of all time. the best musical of all time, if some critics are to be believed. and there definitely is a lot of musical content. the movie sees no problem in bursting into a song and dance number whenever it pleases. id even argue that its a bit much. by the time the seventh or so tap dancing sequence rolled around, i was ready to throw in the towel. granted, some of the song numbers are absolutely phenomenal, like the titular singin in the rain or good morning that comes immediately before it. luckily the film hits its stride around the middle and its a much smoother sailing from there. or i just got used to it. who can say. the acting is also very good, which helps a lot. gene kelly not also directed the film, he also plays the lead role, and hes certainly having a blast with it. debbie reynolds and donald oconnor, playing kellys love interest and best buddy, respectively, are also great and their joined song numbers are easily the most entertaining ones. characterwise, the one thing i didnt quite get is the character of lina lamont jean hagen, the acting partner of kellys character. shes showcased as this great villain and is the primary antagonist of the film, but the way the film tried to portray her never quite matched with the actual character. sure, shes selfcentered, narcissistic and willing to trample others in her pursuit of fame, but she never seemed all that malicious to me. it seemed much more like she didnt know any other way to act. a film that certainly earns its status as a classic. its a product of its era and quite different from modern films, but it has a lot of charm and energy, which carry it far. recommended for fans of the musical genre.",positive
"1. patriotism people in s. korea believe that dwar is going to do well in hollywood and show the world that a korean movie can be as successful as any other blockbusters made in u.s. they dont see dwar as a movie, they see it as a representative of their country. hence the frantic support, just like they did for their soccer team in fifa world cup 2002. 2. nationality somewhat similar to patriotism, dwar includes their national theme song arirang at the ending credits. also during the intro of the movie one of the actors mention the words this is a korean legend.. which again amplifies the fact that it is a korean movie. korean people just love that, as they are all eager to advertise the korean movie to the world. 3. homemade cg until now, almost all of the cgs in the blockbusters made in korea has been imported from overseas. however the cgs in dwar was actually done by a small korean company. this was a major breakthrough for the koreans and this adds more value to the movie in korean peoples perspective as they are able to boast about their cg skills to the rest of the world through dwar. 4. sympathy for the director the director of dwar hyungrae shim was actually a very famous and popular slapstick comedian. during the peak of his career as a comedian, he suddenly decided that he wants to create movies and went on to create quite a few lowbudget movies. they were all criticized and failed horribly in the market due to their lack of quality. shim lost most of his fortune he made as a comedian during this process and people began to sympathize for him. when shim announced that he is making a huge blockbuster costing near 75 million u.s dollars, the public was very supportive of him and the movie as a whole. the combination of all 4 factors mentioned above have turned dwar into a major success in korea. however the critics have criticized the movie for its lack of plot and using the mentioned factors to lure people to see the movie. of course nonkoreans dont care about any of these factors, they only see the movie as it is. this is why the movie wont succeed in the countries other than korea.",negative

"if it werent for angelina jolie, i wouldve fell asleep through the whole damn movie. jolie delivers another spirited performance, and she is an extremely beautiful woman with a smile to die for. but the movie is just dull, dull, dull. first of all, if the director wanted to make this a straight drama thats fine. just dont market it as a comedy! if sentimental schmaltz with few or no laughs is your definition of comedy, then youre in for a treat. the director is stephen herek, who also directed the dull, forgettable eddie murphy vehicle holy man. like that movie, life... is horribly uneven, taking a serious turn way too early in the film and never recovering. despite extremely poor attempts, im pretty sure herek intended this to be a comedy. herek just has no sense of timing! and may i add, there are certain scenes in the previews that werent used in the final cutwhy the hell do directors tease us like that?!!!!!! for example, theres supposed to be one scene where jolie is on the set of a tv show and a light from the ceiling falls down, inches away from killing her. but there are no scenes where her life seems threatened. instead, the movie gets preachy and sentimental about the subject of carpe diem and developing the alltoopredictable love affair between jolie and edward burns. like always, they start out hating each others guts and about 20 minutes through the flick, theyre practically soulmates. the character arcs are so quick and stilted. i like edward burns, but he should definitely stick to independent film. i dont usually say this about directors, but he should stick to starring in his own movies. his writing is obviously much more creative than that of hollywood screenwriters, who get paid 10 times as much as him. ok, he was fairly good in 15 minutes and quite good in saving private ryan, but he should try to steer clear of hollywood. every scene is so dull and downbeat. herek tries to redeem himself with pretentious fastmotion shots, identical to those of madonnas ray of light video. if jolie werent the star, this film would be dead in the water. and tony shalhoub deserves better as well. im not surprised to see him in a corny flick, but he is an underrated comic actor and i loved him on wings. jolie decided she would take a break from movies after done with tomb raider. why, oh why, did she change her mind and star in this ultimately forgettable pseduo romantic comedy? she shouldve saved the blonde hair for a much better movie. my score 4 out of 10",positive

"i really dislike the scary movie series, and since this is same group of idiots, i assumed id hate this film, too. but despite the fact i wanted to hate it, and despite the fact it really was awful, i still feel fairly entertained. and best of all, the film was really short roughly 73 minutes. the bad the is film is nothing more than 50 other movies mostly romances or chick flicks strung together in a very exaggerated way. so if you are looking for something unique, this is the last place you want to check. the acting is also rather poor, and the soundtrack seems to be just kelis and the pussycat dolls repeated over and over. i would not take a date to see this date movie unless she was 12, but then id have bigger problems than this movie. the good i sadly must admit i enjoyed the cat using the toilet. at first it was stupid, but they stretched the scene way beyond the time necessary. sometimes when you repeat a bad joke long enough it becomes great. for me, this was that moment. also, this film featured two of my three favorite buffy actors. alyson hannigan was beautiful and fun, and less obscene than in the american pie movies. and tom lenk shows up in a cameo appearance as frodo baggins, a scene that makes no sense with the rest of the movie but i found to be juxtapositionally hilarious. if only this film also had michelle trachtenberg. the ugly the disgusting parts were actually much less than in the scary movie series. other than pimple joke, i think the only really gross thing was the way this film portrayed fat people. a fat joke here or there i can understand, but they stretched the jokes to the limit with this movie and it was rather nauseating. dont rent this movie. although if you like the stupidity that passes for humor these days, this might be up your alley. heck, i deplore this film and still confess i laughed out loud at least twice. but dont tell anyone i said that, because this movie is not good.",negative

"the movie tries something that hadnt been done for a long time. it tries to reach out and tickle the one sense that isnt being reached out to smell. the fact that you have to scratch a number on a piece of paper you get, every time it appears on screen, can be a pain though. still kudos for trying something. that wont help with the story, that is too easy to see and guess for any adult. but they are not the main audience for this movie. this is aimed mostly at kids. they might kinda like it. its not as bad for them and if you watch it with them, you might enjoy it because of that. im not sure if they will include smell cards for the dvdblu ray ... and how long the smell lasts. apart from the gimmick there is not that much more there.",negative
"the third part of every trilogy usually ruins the series. toy story 3 was almost a victim because the plot was suppose to be about buzz having a defect and he was shipped to taiwan to be fixed but instead hes going to be replace by another buzz lightyear, and the other toys will rescue him. if thats the plot of toy story 3 then it will be an unnecessary sequel. but good thing pixar changed it in to a better plot. everyones favorite childhood movie is back to the big screen and it is still the same old toy story movie that we always love! toy story 3 is one of the best sequels of all time. the reason why other third parts of the trilogy fails because they didnt have a great story. pixar never made a bad movie yet because they care about the story of their movies. the movie is nonstop entertainment. there are no boring parts. even the parts with no dialog are so entertaining. the old characters still have their same old personality. the new characters are fun to watch, but too bad mr. pricklepants didnt have enough screen time. i liked that character even though he didnt have enough scenes. randy newmans music score is a little nostalgic to the first two toy story movies. toy story 3 is darker, suspenseful, exciting, and has more drama than the first two movies. the movie also has a large scale. this might be the biggest sequel of the year! poor ol dreamworks, they have finally made a classic but still their rival is still going to beat them. so better luck next time dw. animated movies this year are overwhelming and amustseetothebigscreenthandvdandbluray. you might be asking what is the best toy story movie?, the answer is .... all of them! all three toy story movies are classics and unforgettable. sequels doesnt need big action and explosions to be good. its all about the story. i think toy story needs to end here. 55 stars! best movie of the year!",positive
"im kind of astonished by all the harsh reviews of this one... i found it pretty entertaining, albeit in a very silly way. i think the only way to approach a movie like this one is to realize right from the beginning that ordinary rules of logic are not going to apply, and stop expecting things to be remotely realistic or plausible, because theyre not going to be. its a deliberately ridiculous, overthetop, screwball comedy, and if you expect any sort of realism or logic from it, then yes, youre going to be disappointed. it seems like some of the other reviewers were expecting something a little more serious and sensible, and i could certainly see how this film could be jarring if thats what youre after. but if youre just looking for something campy and fun, and are prepared to completely suspend disbelief, then its definitely worth watching!",negative
"ladies and gentlemen, here it is, adam sandlers worst moviei like comedy when it is funny. i have to admit though, apart from punch drunk love, reign over me, spanglish, the wedding singer, 50 first dates and happy gilmore i have never liked adam sandler. i often find his acting style irritating, his characters unlikeable and apart from five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point to them. as much as i didnt think much of little nicky, you dont mess with the zohan, funny people and i now pronounce you chuck and larrygenerally anger management, the longest yard, click and the waterboy i had mixed feelings on neither of them are as painful to watch as this one. the trailer was enough to make me wish the ground had swallowed me up, and the film managed to be every bit as bad. so why did i see jack and jill in the first place if i didnt like sandler? one reason really. al pacino. i consider this man a great actor, and this is not just the godfather, dog day afternoon, scent of a woman and carlitos way as i consider his performance in godfather part ii one of the alltime great male performances. when i saw the movie on tinyurl, having an inkling it would be bad but pacino would be at least decent, in my opinion this is as awful as i was hearing. this is not just adam sandlers worst film, but also one of the worst of the year and one of the worst ive seen recently. jack and jill is a cheaplooking movie, with not much attention to slick editing or continuity and the lighting also manages to be dull. of sandlers movies, jack and jill is perhaps the worstdirected, because the director throughout seemed to be rushing through it. the soundtrack at best is forgettable, and doesnt seem dynamic with whats going on on screen. the acting is awful. adam sandler is a big part of the films problem. none of his characters are likable, instead they are very annoying and sandlers performance is samey and irritating throughout. not only that, jill is introduced too quickly with a severe lack of buildups, and sandler as a woman in all honesty is not pretty, sorry i had to say. i was hoping that al pacino would elevate just a little bit, as he was the only redeeming quality of gigli, another example of a bad film. alas, he spends the entire movie looking bored, almost as if what am i doing here, and the performance reads very much of him playing himself. the cameos dont engage either, they are not funny, in fact pretty much nobody seems to have a sense of comic timing, and just come and go. nicky swardson fares best, surprising seeing as i dont regard him very highly either. worse are the script, characters and story. in regards to the script and the humour, jack and jill fails utterly. the dialogue is atrocious, very immature and hackneyed, while the physical and visual humour just left a bad taste in the mouth. i get that it was meant to be funny and not to be exactly subtle, but the poop jokes for example got really embarrassing and left me more disgusted than amused.!",negative
"as a fan of the addams i was really exited to watch the series, especially since its highly recommended on the internet. in my opinion, the show seems off. the main character, wednesday, is just a bratty teenager that gives off the most cringey vibe. the second hand embarrassment thatll get from this show is real. the writing is just bad... its full with teenage school drama that i dont really get and the word patriarchy thrown around for wokeness points. the jokes arent funny, nor witty, they are there to fill some pages and some screentime. im glad that there are people who really like the show, but for me its just a parody of a reboot.",positive
"absolutely astonishing piece of movie making, doesnt feel dragged at any point and the very essence of excess is maintained throughout the movie. at the bottom of it all, scorsese tries to show a picture so unbelievable you can actually see it happening, and not for a moment does it feel like weve escaped the real world, just that weve pushed its boundaries of what is okay and acceptable. various scenes that may seem pointless paint a picture of a lifestyle so hopeless we cant help but feel sad for everyone involved.",positive
"star wars. indiana jones. fistful of dollars. bourne. these are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. yes, i am neglecting the fourth indiana jones. upon the mention of the third toy story, i was deathly afraid. afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. the original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film i mean that. the first two toy story films are among the best movies of alltime and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in toy story. could part 3 even come close to the original two? my friends, i am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes. toy story 3 does exactly what the first two did, delivered on all cylinders, all aspects of filmmaking and entertainment. the humor is back, the heart is back, the delightful cast of characters is back. this time, thanks to an incredible script, theres more suspense, more drama, and many more surprises. like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends. it literally is difficult to find any flaw or any slow moment in this movie, and even if there is, it will immediately be forgiven by the next major laugh or the next major revelation. the predictability factor in this movie is low, and the payoff to all the suspense is extremely high. guys, this is the goto movie of the summer, and makes up for any disappointment you have seen this year or last. just like toy story 2s subtle and underlying themes, toy story 3 revolves around the group of toys and their latest adventure, but dwells far deeper than that. on the surface, this movie is about the toys in a series of circumstances, winding up in a daycare center that isnt all it seems. at the same time, andy is heading for college, but woody isnt quite ready to let go of his owner and the memories that follow. the deeper aspects involve aging, growing up, and moving on. michael arndt, the oscar winner that wrote little miss sunshine, was behind the spectacular screenplay in this third trip in the world of toys. then with the help of john lasseter and lee unkrich who serves as the director, we see plenty of references to pixar, other movies, the previous toy story installments, and even we even see nods to the influences of the entire animation studio miyazaki. the writing wasnt the only thing that was on par with the first two toy story movies. the voice acting cast was once again phenomenal, with popular actors, underrated talent, and great character actors filling the bill. come on now, just read em tim allen, tom hanks, john cusack, wallace shawn, jody benson, estelle harris, blake clark, john ratzenburger, ned beatty, jeff garlin, and michael keaton. unlike what dreamworks pulls off on a yearly basis, pixar carefully chooses their voice cast in terms of pulling off the best performances, not to generate more money. because honestly, was there even a point to angelina jolie voicing the tiger in kung fu panda? on the other hand, very few can pull an authentic barbie like jody benson a.k.a. ariel in the little mermaid. it takes reliable and authentic acting to pull at the heartstrings, and everyone definitely was on their agame. lee unkrich directed this movie with incredible pacing and just as much heart and dedication as lasseter, who was in charge of the first two. the truth is, pixar directs the movie together, as they share ideas and suggestions amongst each other. this fact can be traced to the similar pacing and directing styles seen in pixars better works like ratatoille, finding nemo, and up. they all have the similar technique of incorporating just as many tears as laughs. but unlike all the other pixar movies with the exception of the incredibles, toy story 3 has a heave dosage of suspense and peril, which is climaxed by one of the most exciting animated sequences this side of castle in the sky a miyazaki adventure masterpiece. other reviewers have noted this before me, but this toy story is quite scary in depth and in imagery at some instances, so be wary of this while watching this with the kids. with so much time invested with these toys, the drama runs a bit high. bottom line toy story 3 secures its place in cinema brilliance by becoming the best third installment since indiana jones and the last crusade, the best sequel since kill bill vol. 2, and the best movie weve seen this year. this movie is usually hilarious, sometimes thrilling, and sometimes downright tearjerking. and yes, just like ups opening 10 minutes, there is that one major sequence in which pixar will play with your heartstrings like eric clapton playing tears of heaven. if you enjoyed the first two toy stories, theres no need to worry about the third and hopefully final chapter in the qualityfilled saga. how pixar manages to deliver yet again is absolutely beyond me. walt disney may not be onehundred percent proud of his company if he were alive to see it now, but he would be absolutely delighted at seeing what beautiful art pixar has delivered ever since 1995. pixar has recreated walt disney s magical methods of storytelling and moviemaking, and arguably has taken it a step even further by adding depth to the characters and depth to the overall stories presented. the direction was fantastic, the writing was oscarworthy, and the overall production is best picture caliber. this is pixars best work since finding nemo, and a must see by any means necessary. despite my cynical nature, theres no way i can grade this any less than perfect. just no way.",positive
"honestly if you want to see this movie because it looks funny, you should still see it. the only reason this movie got bad reviews is because it is a horrible movie. however if you want to go just to laugh, you should definitely see it. in my opinion, it is one of the funniest ones so far.no scary movie movies are supposed to be good movies, theyre supposed to be funny movies. thats the point, they are made to be that way. critics should know that. its a 0.510 for a good movie but 910 for the funny parts. dont listen to the critics they dont know what theyre talking about . movies i recommend you see before just watching it paranormal activity 4 black swan cabin in the woods planet of the apes evil dead",positive
"to begin with, i never had high expectations for rollerball. it was supposed to be released what seems like years ago, and kept getting pushed back. that being said, one would think that meant they were making it better. thank god they didnt fix it any more than they did. other than the great jean reno, whom i now pity for being in this movie i was left wondering where the hell the actors and actresses were. i couldnt find any. did anyone else? the editing was terrible and the blair witch cameraman did a better job showing us what was going on. the supposed action scenes were extremely tough to follow and frustrating. four minutes of night vision didnt help either. the cartoony boing! of going through a fence got me laughing, as did the supposed speed of 120 mph as we see the road passing underneath them at about 30. and how about that fight at the end? wow... that was about as exciting as watching grass grow. when it was all over, i was amazed that it was only an hour and a half long. the ever so slight glimmer of hope of slipknots performance was quickly dashed by more bad acting and editing. im tempted to take the dvd back to the rental store and demand a refund. if nothing else, tell them to pull the copies of this abomination from their shelves to save business. giving myself a root canal while being held over hot coals with gremlins twisting corkscrews into my feet would have been more entertaining. do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague. you have been warned.",negative

"scorsese and dicaprios fifth venture together, this might be their most mainstream attempt till now. this blackhearted comedy, filled with colour, glamour, parties, money, corruption, drugs and sex, oozes of energy throughout its threehour long runtime. i admit its a funfilled ride throughout, and it never gets boring. but after a certain point, the narration, the jokes and the parties get monotonous. for such a long movie, the characterdevelopment and characterexploration is very poor, and there are so many characters and scenes which dont have any special relevance or importance in the whole story being told. i cant believe its terence winter from the sopranos and boardwalk empire who wrote the script. the main distraction while watching a biopic like this is that the things shown on screen fabulous office parties, amount of drugs each of the them take within a day, their ability to function properly in such high, the money lavishly spent around, and so many other things always make you wonder how much of it is accurate and how much of it is complete exaggeration you dont get a clear picture of the people and lifestyle of that place and era. but whatever you say, with whatever is given to him, leonardo audaciously gets into the skin of the character and is fascinating to watch. moira macdonald from seattle times aptly says, dicaprio is positively reptilian he spits out his lines with a nasty glee. youre both horrified and enchanted by this creature a monster in armani. and jonah hill is almost as integral to the movie as dicaprio himself hes hilariously terrific from beginning till end. i like that the movie doesnt shy away from being filthy. plus scorseses depiction of a modern tragedy as an epic farce works to its advantage. looks like scorsese was in quite a fun mood or pretty high like the movies characters while making this. though its a hysterical and thoroughlyentertaining journey, i still dont understand why scorsese and dicaprio jumped into making this completely exaggerated alleged life of a convicted swindler. anyway, the feature is good not great. with a little more depth, the movie could have been timeless.",positive

"alright, alright, alright. one of the best and most influential teen comedy films ever made. dazed and confused is among my alltime favourites. i have seen this movie so many times that i have lost count. richard linklater is one of my favorite directors and in the top 3 when it comes to directing comingofage movies. he gets it. he understands teenagers, how they behave, how they talk, how they waste their time talking crap. he has done such a tremendous job of capturing those teenage emotions in this movie, and in his later works too, which many great directors have failed to depict convincingly. every performance, every dialogue feels natural and improvised rather than scripted, and thats the genius of richard linklater and the cast. set in the postvietnam era of the 70s, this movie is about some bunch of teenagers chilling out on the last day of school before vacations. the upperclassmen are looking for freshmen prey and the incoming freshmen are trying to avoid them, and theres also a party being thrown. it can also be termed as a stoner comedy because almost every character is either getting high or drunk in the movie. it might put some viewers off, but it realistically portrays the lives of american teens in that era as i heard. ragging of juniors by the seniors is hilarious and pretty relatable. the acting is goofy for the most part, but it doesnt affect the experience and makes the characters seem like real people. the pacing is excellent, the movie doesnt get boring at any point. the soundtrack features 70s rock songs and they are amazing. each track is more than capable to put anyone in a good mood and enjoy the movie. the movie is wild, nonstop fun, and has aged really well for a teen movie.",positive

"you should not watch back to the future looking for serious, intriguing thought experiments regarding time travel. you should watch it for what it is a hollywood blockbuster that seeks to make money through peoples entertainment. and the profitseeking motive is quite clear from the beginning you see brand placement everywhere. back to the future, then, has all the ingredients for a hollywood blockbuster funny characters, unlikely plot denouements that you see coming way before it happens, very clich characters such as the town bully, the timid nerd that becomes a hero, the damsel in distress. also, as a 1985 blockbuster, it includes racism and sexism that would probably not be tolerated nowadays, such as the main actor shouting the libyans! as a synonym of the bad guys!, or the main character literally planning to abuse of a girl, which happens to be his mother. that being said, the movie does achieve it main goal it is truly entertaining. im not the kind of person who laughs out loud when watching comedies, but in this case i couldnt avoid it. there are truly remarkable situations, especially with martys mother. the doctors character is also particularly wellmade, and the actors performance is notable. in general, the creators did a good job in showing all the different funny situations that would arise from bringing an 80s kid to 1955, such as him playing rockn roll in front of an awed audience, or marty saying that a tv program that is just being aired is a classic that he watched in a rerun. so once you understand you shouldnt have high hopes for this movie, and that you should only look for having a good time, this movie will be very satisfactory. there are more artistic movies, better written plots, better directed ones, even funnier ones. but very often, these movies dont remain in the collective imaginary in the way this did it. the way this movie is part of todays pop culture should not be understated.",positive

"this is everything someone who enjoys animes could ever ask for. let me explain epic battles that arent stretched for 5 episodes. the story plot is so twisted but yet there are no flaws or loop holes. the explanations make sense and are fun to listen to. there is a balance between the intense gory moments and the light hearted jokish moments. the characters are liakable, even the villains. its just the perfect anime. and dont listen to those people who say that this version is rubbish compared to the 1999 version. its ten times better. the show might start of a little childish but its picks up the pace in no time. i recommend this to anyone i meet...literally. its just that damn good",positive

"smug and a selfadorned cinesophisticate, i rented out gigli with a friend ready to scrutinise it with the benefit of my enlightened view of film. it was going to be an hilarious two hours. id settled down in a very comfy armchair and had poured a glass of some austrian glug. i couldnt wait to laugh at the stupid dialogue and that ridiculous script but the joke was on us because gigli transcends the established limit of effective urine stealing. this is because its simply so horrible that you can forget trying to make yourself look intelligent and media literate by ripping the bladder evacuate because the scale of misguided conception baffles the mind and eventually shuts it down. its like being hit by a sack full of bricks in the face for a full 114 minutes. theres a teasing little scene with jlo early on when she tells a bunch of unruly kids that theres a martial arts move that can gouge out the eyes and simultaneously destroy the visual cortex meaning that not only are you rendered blind but youll never be able to remember anything youve seen. for the gigli viewer this is like showing charlie and the chocolate factory to a hall packed with diabetics. youre left to ponder the short term agony weighed up against the long term benefit as martin brests story unfolds with the principle characters of a unlikeable, emotionally and sexually retarded thug with a soft centre a fat affleck, a lesbian who isnt really a lesbian because you can be converted to heterosexuality by an emotionally and sexually retarded thug and an actually retarded man who was probably supposed to be a rainmantype character who redeems afflecks arrogant meathead but is in fact a cringe inducing, selfharm facilitating caricature of the mentally handicapped. look, many movies look good on paper and suffer from poor execution but whats head scratching about gigli is that its as dire on the page as it is on screen. broadly its supposed to be a romantic comedy, sort of out of sight meets rainman meets whats new pussycat? but its stillborn as a criminal caper, devoid of anything approaching sensitivity and has some of the worst battle of the sexes banter that ever crawled onto the screen. brest, who directed the dire 16 hour remake of meet john doe, meet joe black, shows that when it comes to misjudging material hes peerless. his crimes here are compounded by the fact that this is his own script. that script, incidentally is a roll call of on screen horror. witness, if you can, the penis vs. vagina scene in which affleck argues the case for the male genitals or the tear jerking moment in which the soft hearted affleck, having given the mentally handicapped brian relationship advice, looks on like a proud father as his new friends woos an australian bombshell during the filming of a baywatch beach party. youll envy the man who gets his brains blown out and eaten by goldfish or the horrendous girlfriend of jlo, who having realised which film shes in, slits her wrists...stupidly, the wrong way. once its all over and you sit there open mouthed youre left to briefly ponder why brest did it. did the kidnapped brother have to be disabled? surely there must have been a more effective way of facilitating afflecks transition from idiot to slightly more compassionate idiot? did jlo have to be a lesbian? sure, affleck has to have some obstacles toward getting the girl and we all like a bit of sexual tension but gay viewers must have been flabbergasted that a man who describes men and women as the bull and the cow and does lovable things like warmly looking vacuous and endearingly been obnoxious should persuade a woman to er, hop over the fence. and even if brest was blinded by his own vanity what in the name of beverly hills cop persuaded christopher walken and al pacino to cameo? none of it makes any sense. the bottle of wine i had with the film was good though but by the time i regained consciousness the bit left in the bottle was undrinkable.",negative
"honestly, if you are a true theater lover dancer you can embrace this movie. ive been a fan of cats since a small child talking 4 years old and i have also had the wonderful fortune of seeing a production live as well as performing in one as a singer and featured dancer. i felt this adaptation was pretty well thought out and executed to a great level for the big screen. it had the playfulness and musical power of the stage production thank you, andrew llyod weber, executive producer and executive music director with all of the performers really embracing their roles and performing at an amazing level. you get so much more context from this movie and there seems to more plot line then in the original story. i loved the added dialogue to create the context and loved the character choices of idris alba and the director tom hopper to bring macavity more to life then in the original broadway production. i felt every actor and actress in this version executed their characters very well thank you to robbie fairchild as munkstrap my fave cat! but an exceptional shout out to jennifer hudson who embodied such a beautiful version of grizabella! memory made me cry as far as cgi if you can go to a marvel movie and see josh brolin as thanos and have no issue or see a youngified version of michael douglas then why is there such an issue with seeing performers as cats in cgi?? when i performed in the show it was leotards, wigs with cat ears, loads of makeup and tails that swung around lifeless while sometimes getting caught during the dancing at least in the movie version we get tails that are interactive. so inconclusion, i could continue to rave about each individual character, the settings, the directorial choices, dance, etc. but i leave with if you are a theater nerd or you are a dancer this movie is for you. dancers les twins are featured and the jellical ball is phenomenally executed. but haters got to hate i guess.....",negative

"when i was 10, i adored the simpsons, americas favourite dysfunctional family. me and my brother and sisters watched it every day after school, and got a bagful of laughs. two years ago though, i stopped watching it. maybe i didnt find it as funny, creative or as original anymore. well after seeing the simpsons movie, i decided to give the show another chance. and i am glad i did, because it is smart, creative, funny and original. it is true that the show has been declining in written quality the past three years or so, but the more recent seasons are still watchable, thanks to the animation and the endearing characters. the shows animation is fantastic. in animated shows, i like animation that is colourful and fluid, and the animation in this show is exactly that. the theme tune is irresistibly catchy and the story lines are outstandingly good. other than the voice acting what made the show so good was its writing. not obnoxious or childish, but smart and most importantly funny. and the visual jokes are also impressive. and the voice acting is exceptional bringing the dysfunctional family to life. homer is a type of father figure who repeatedly lets down his family, has a love for doughnuts and beer and pretty much hates his job. dan castallenetta, a talented voice actor whom i fondly remember as megavolt from darkwing duck, does a great job not only as homer but as grandpa and krusty, not loud and abrasive at all but just right. julie kavner is also great as marge, a caring matriarch who genuinely cares for her family. nancy cartwright is perfect as bart, who is quite naughty and hates school, same with yeardley smith as studious lisa. plus maggie is absolutely adorable. then there are the supporting characters. my favourite is grandpa, he is absolutely hilarious. hank azaria is amusing as moe and chief wiggum, and harry shearer is suitably chirpy as ned and impresses equally with his monotonic drawls for principal skinner and reverend lovejoy. there are many memorable guest performances from various celebrities, and frequent appearances from phil hartmann and tress macneille. my favourite is kelsey grammar as sideshow bob, a reprising villain i enjoy watching, sinister yet funny. all in all, despite the fact it isnt as enjoyable as it was, the simpsons is still a great show. 9.510 bethany cox",positive

"the greatness of a memorable film emerges from an exceptional director like martin scorsese. this film entitled the wolf of wall street was written by jordon belfort whos malicious deceptive practices eventually earn him a stint in federal prison. taken from the excessive exploits of jordon belfort himself, it tells the story of a unemployed wall street executive who was abruptly layed off but despite his fall, landed on his feet. despite falling, he arose quickly to create a new financial institution which not only netted him millions, but created a whole new way to acquire further riches. leonardo dicaprio plays jordan belfort, an enterprising salesman with a golden gift of gab. inspired by matthew mcconaughey and his own convincing talent, belfort take a converted garage, added an exceptional sales crew, transform them into a sea of voracious financial sharks like rob reiner. belfort then creates a lucrative financial institution which nets them untold millions. achieving his ultimate success, he continues onward and upwards attracting the attention of wall street itself and of course agent patrick denham of the f.b.i. in addition, belfort also seeks out and weds the love of his life naomi lapaglia margot robbie who brings romantic security and domestic headaches as well.the movie is fast paced, money, drug and sex oriented along with the life style of the rich and famous. dicaprio is in his element in this movie as are the talented actors of scorseses cast, who showcase what can happen when unbridled greed meets unrestricted wealth. this film will rank as a classic in time and will become a milestone for scorsese and decaprio. recommended, but with definite warning to one and all.",negative

"dragonball is arguably the best mangaanime ever made. it has an immense amount of popularity that has transcended cultures and become a profitable mainstream commodity worldwide. it has stood the test of time and has been a great inspiration to so many after it. with that said, this movie is a travesty to the product name. the rich characters and carefully crafted story of the manga are carelessly shotgunned onto the screen. the dialog is poor, the acting never gets any better than what wed find on a mediocre evening kids show, the cg bounces unevenly between barely passable and awful, and most importantly, the fight scenes and lack of just plain stink. dragonball has always been about being epic and larger than life. one glance at the cartoon would demonstrate how they would spend a ridiculous amount of time on building up a fight and then pay it all off with a great one. the manga was always about fantastical ideas, crazy fighting styles, even crazier special moves, and the all important which fighter is stronger debate that was made exponentially better once power levels got involved in dbz. simply put, none of this magic was brought over, and too much time is spent on things dragonball was never known for. dragonball was never about romance, as it was about family, friendship, and respect. in fact, the gokuchi chi relationship was never emphasized in the comic and always took a back seat to the important matters at hand, like saving the world and working together to accomplish that. the film must have spent like 25 of the time trying to build up this relationship when the manga might have spent 0.1. i honestly do not believe this kind of lowest common denominator to attract the interest of the female audience was necessary at all. dragonball never had trouble creating a fan base, so this really feels like one of the many big missteps of the film. in terms of the characters, they really made a mistake in blending the young and old goku of the original story, which resulted in one that just seems unlikable. goku was always a bit goofy and was certainly flawed, but he was never a dope like the one we see here. people not familiar with the manga will probably come off with absolutely no idea why goku is so well adored by all the fans. next, the ultimate bad boy piccolo is completely underused with very little screen time. yamcha is nothing like the one we know, and is made to be a bad comic relief of some sort. chow yun fats roshi is close to unwatchable. you cannot blame chow yun fat for trying his best, but hes just a terrible miscast for the role. fat does the cool stuff well, but this stuff just isnt in his nature, and it shows. rossums bulma actually comes off alright and is probably the best character adaptation out of all of them. she looks great in the role and does pretty much everything youd expect out of bulma. dragonball is the crown jewel of the mangaanime business, which makes it only that much more disappointing that the people involved with this film clearly did not understand what people liked so much about it in the first place. it plays like a bmovie with dclass quality in everything except budget. fortunately, dragonball is just too big for even this big tub of junk to cause any long lasting hurt to the franchise.",negative

"so this is it? one of the most acclaimed and praised movies of the 80s? this?! im not sure im watching the same movie as all these folks so positive about this one. it tries to be very deep an meaningful but to be honest, it really goes nowhere. we have a pretentious bully, a spoilt daddys girl, sports guy, a nerd and of course, a retard all in detention. what happens throughout the movie? in the beginning, they just have random scuffles with one another. and later, they open up to each other and basically talk and rant about their incredibly clichd teenage problems. hmmm, didnt you guys hate each other like 2 seconds ago? and then theres the stupid note, which is also supposed to be very in depth, towards the teacher who put them in detention which reads you see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. correct? yeah, and even after the movie is over i see you as the exact same people, except perhaps the bully, who was also probably the only interesting guy in the whole movie but his character too was ruined towards the end. and, there is a scene where all of these idiots start dancing to synth rock music for no reason inside the school. how the hell did they find rock music inside the school while in detention anyway? plus, the ending is completely idiotic and unbelievable. the worst thing about the movie is that i dont feel anything for any of the students. i mean, they couldve dropped dead any second in the movie and i wouldnt have given a rats ass. as this is a drama, were actually supposed to feel for them in at least one way or another. well, i didnt. and its not that i have a stone cold heart. the last scene of up put me on the verge of tears. i fail to see why this movie couldnt do something that would make most people feel emotionally attached to the characters. even if the overall idea of the movie isnt that bad, the execution seems completely terrible to me. the acting, cinematography etc. might be good but the overall plot does not come together well at all.",positive

"i really could not understand the fuss around this show at first and in fact it took me three attempts to get through season one which in my humble opinion is grossly overrated and is a fairly pedestrian and dour production with occasional mildly humorous moments along the way. season two however is an entirely different matter. it simply flies by with fabulous performances all around, some great laugh out loud moments, stunning locations with beautiful cinematography and a great score. the cast are universally excellent with jennifer coolidge winning an emmy as the intensely needy tanya, one of only two characters who appeared in season one. simona tabasco is great fun as lucia the sex worker, f murray abraham provides plenty of laughs as grandad bert, tom hollander is perfect as the stylish but shady quentin and aubrey plaza shines as harper the uptight lawyer who really doesnt want to be there. i enjoyed every episode of season two and id rate it as 8.5. thanks to richard osman from the rest is entertainment podcast for effectively recommending it as an upgrade on season one which it certainly was. id rate that earlier season as 5.5 hence the overall rating of 7 and i only completed it as a curiosity after watching this great season 2. if you are new to this my advice is go straight to season 2, theres no need to have seen the first season and it may even put you off. as a final thought sicily looks absolutely spectacular ive no doubt a few holidays were booked after watching it!",positive

for the life of me i cannot figure out the absolute terrible takes that the rotten tomatoes website has on actually good tv shows and movies. they literally called this a cw show with wednesday addams. i was shocked because ill be honest this is probably the best experience ive had watching a show on netflix since the first season of stranger things. not only is it one of the best shows ive seen this year but its probably one of the best things that tim burton has done in a very long time. jenna ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. which is also the thing that i like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. its not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the addams family personalities and relationships. the burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. if you look at it more through the angle of wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. so for me personally i really dont understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on cw... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and its also very smart in the approach that they have with the addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in. please give this a watch this is a good show!,positive

"i know everybody is saying how lame this movie is and that its nothing like the anime,that everyone was out of character and that it generally sucked...but i beg to differ.this movie is based on the graphic novel...based on!!...so its supposed to be almost nothing like the movie.i hate how everyone thinks that a live action movie of a manga is supposed to contain every single detail,but its almost impossible to get all that information in an hour and a half movie.so what do you do? you make your own story so it can fit the time.if the lord of the rings movies or harry potter movies contained all the details of the book then the movies would be 5 hour plus movies. i thought it was an awesome movie.it didnt portray the actual manga,but it fits more the profile of a tribute to dragonball. so summed up this movie was a tribute.",negative
i find the show just offbeat enough for me. its funny. it teaches lifes lessons in a playful way. there is a large cast which they need to work with . i hope to see characters backgrounds that i have yet to see in the second season. there is so much to explore and expand on on. im still wondering about the ghost boundary among other things. they seem to get themselves into a pickle but by the end they work themselves out somehow. i like it.. there is a lot of room left for them to highlight a lot of stuff. i look forward to learning more about them as i watch. like how did the indian die? how many ghost are there in the basement anyways? what are all this powers? we still dont know many of these thing by the beginning of season 2. and thats where i am....season 2.,positive

"i have actually never heard of hobgoblins before 2016, when i happened to stumble across the movie by sheer random luck. and being a fan of creature features and horror movies in general, of course i gave hobgoblins a chance, well knowing that i most likely wasnt in for something grand. and i should have taken heed to the low rating of hobgoblins on imdb and stayed well clear of the movie. yes, this movie is every bit as to be expected given the synopsis and the rating it has received. the story is about some aliens who are confined to a facility, where they are accidentally released from captivity as a new security guard opens a vault that is supposed to be off limits. this is from the late 1980s, so of course expectations should be set accordingly. but even for a movie from this age then hobgoblins was pathetic. the acting in the movie was amateurish at best. i am not sure if it was because of the lack of having a proper script to work with, or if it was because they had opted to go with talents not really up for the task of acting. and the creatures, well lets just take a moment here to talk about them. while they did have some good conceptual ideas for their appearances, then the creatures just didnt work out so well on the screen, especially since it was so obviously clear that they were just puppets without movable parts. it was embarrassing to witness. before i forget, i should also mention the editing and cutting of hobgoblins. wow, that was just abysmal to watch. this was probably some of the worst movie editing that i have ever seen. i didnt last through the entire movie here, because i just gave up on it before even reaching the half way point. and i have no interest in finishing the movie. and i just found out that there apparently is a sequel to this abysmal movie but again, i have no interest in watching that, not after having seen enough of part one to see what it was. i cant find any reason for why anyone should take the time to sit down and watch hobgoblins, much less actually invest any money or time in doing so.",negative

"mac and me was one of the more infamous box office duds of its time. while this would dissuade normal folks from watching it, bad movie buffs like me naturally gravitate to it because it is such a legendary flop. the biggest reason it failedthe public quickly saw it for what it really wasa blatant ripoff of e.t.. and, this time even more corporate references are thrown in the viewers face...with mcdonalds and coke references galore!! instead of reeses pieces, they feed this godawful corporate shill skittles! and, to revive macs family who are on the edge of death, they feed them coke!!! the film begins with an incredibly ugly family of aliens mysteriously getting sucked into a us space probe. they are then deposited on earth and their baby, mac, is lost and must find its way home. in the process it meets a nice disabled kid and makes his life complete. but, when its no longer safe, he and elliot, i mean eric, go on a cross country race to find his parents and get him homeand evade capture. and to do this, they dress him up in a halloweentype costume! need i continue?! so is the film any good? well, if et had never been made, sure it would have been reasonably entertaining to very young kids who didnt notice that the film was a giant commercial and who wouldnt notice the bad dialog and abounding clichs. but et had been already made several years earlier...so the film has zip when it comes to originality. you wonder how the folks associated with the film feltthey must have been really embarrassed at how blatant this was. and, at just about every turn it seems to do it worse than et...and often much worse. its a vacuous, soulsucking corporate mess of a film in so many ways. when i saw this film tonight, it was decades after its original release and i was startled how ugly and expressionless mac was. however, i had to remind myself that et also looks pretty crappy when you see him today because we are used to much better special effects in 2015though mac is definitely crappier. the worst is when the dead, expressionless doll is riding on erics lap during the big chase! as for the outer space scene, however, i watched it on a very big screen tv and i was surprised because it looked so nice. this space scene along with actually hiring a disabled kid to play a disabled kid are about the only things that impressed me about the film. otherwise, a pointless ripoff from start to finishand not even bad enough to make bad movie buffs laugh. but enough overt corporate references to make this a great film to use as a drinking gametaking a shot every time you saw these blatant ads! believe me, you would get stinking drunk if you tried this!! by the way, the kid calls the hideous little alien macan acronym for mysterious alien creature. in no way was this meant to be like et for the extraterrestrial....yeah, right! also, perhaps its just me, but this might just be the most whitebread, corporate and uncool film ever madeespecially during the godawful mcdonalds dance scene.",negative

"this film presents a fascinating concept that should satisfy scifi fans, offering rich worldbuilding and thoughtprovoking ethical and philosophical dilemmas that arise from scientific progress. however, despite the intriguing premise, the main character feels too passive, seeming more resigned than engaged. he doesnt actively drive the plot forward, and his lack of clear motivation makes it difficult for the audience to fully connect with him. while the film raises compelling questions, perhaps a stronger, more dynamic protagonist could have made the story more engaging and emotionally resonant.",positive

"this is the perfect combination between brutal, dark, controversial, and funny, and sarcastic, witty. what i love about this show is how the scenes can go from very serious to funny and ironic. the actors are cast perfectly for their roles, and every character is well written with a good story and development. i think the boys is almost 10x better than marvel and dc. everything about it is better, the characters, the actors, the plot, the brutality, the sarcasm and the irony. i think its hilarious how this show portraits the american politics and propaganda. you can almost call it a parody of the american government. season one started of great, and season two was even better in my opinion. season three is probably my favorite season and thats because of the fight scenes and because of a lot of characters backstorys. many people thinks that season four is far from as good as the other seasons, but i enjoyed season four, and i saw it as kind of a build up to season five. if you need a good watch, this is the perfect show for you. i binged it and its probably my favorite show of all time.",positive

"this is one of the most horrifyingly awful films of all time. it would an embarrassment to your local dump to find this movie wallowing in there. its not even worthy of that! shaquille oneal delivers a performance that gasp! is worse than his awful performance in kazaam! apparently, after the mild success and small critical praise of shaqs performance in blue chips, he thought he had a chance at a real acting career. i would like to know who it was that encouraged him to go forth with two more lead roles in his career?! the only reason he did so well in blue chips was because he was basically playing himself! casting shaq in this big, lumbering idiot of a role is so bad, it actually makes us laugh...hard. the costuming is a joke. its all too obvious that shaq is wearing a rubber helmet when its supposed to be made of steel! he also looks just plain ridiculous in that suit. he looks like an oversized kid ready for halloween, as he has to strain to peer through the eye holes. he just looks like a metallic turd. the special effects are mediocre at best, and the rest of the cast is bland. judd nelson, whos career said byebye back in the 80s, is among the worst villains in movie history, and certainly didnt help his career any. the story is ludicrous and often makes no sense...that is, when there is an actual story to follow, and the dialogue is so bad, that they have to resort to stealing lines from other, far better, action movies!! after this, its plain to see why you didnt see another comicbook based movie for a while excluding batman robin, which was a joke in itself. this movie literally killed the comic book movie for almost a decade.",negative

"paddington the cute and cuddly bear returns for another adventure literally in this case. paddington is still living happily in london with the brown family. henry now works for an insurance firm, mary is taking on an art project, judy is about to go to college, and jonathan is an inventor. the original cast members return, except for sally hawkins. the role of mary brown will now be played by emily mortimer. the reverand mother at the home of retired bears contacts paddington with news about his aunt lucy. paddington decides to go see her in peru, and the brown family joins him to spend more time together. on arrival in peru, they are told aunt lucy went missing, and so paddington and the browns rent a boat and head off into the amazon. the boat is owned by the charming hunter cabot antonio banderas and his daughter gina. their search for lucy is about to take them to rumi rock, the entrance to the mythical el dorado said to be filled with gold. hunters family has been searching for el dorado for centuries and he is determined not to fail...and the secret lies with paddington. ok, i admire them for taking the franchise in a different direction, but lets be honest, this is not a very well made movie. apart from the cgi bears paddington in particular the film looks cheap. fake trees, fake plants, fake planes, fake forest, fake everything. paddington in peru was so obviously shot in a studio against green and blue screens, with everything else added in postproduction. with a budget of 90 million i expected the film to look much better, but i suppose most of this budget went into creating the cgi bears, which is understandable since paddington cant possibly be an actual bear. still, ive seen cheaper movies set in the amazon or any forest for that matter which looked a lot more authentic. when the family was wondering through the forest, it looked as if they were on a stage filled with stage dcor and props. even their acting did not to their environment justice. but lets not get too critical about the movies looks. this movie is definitely aimed more at a young demographic, and kids wont really know the difference. they will enjoy the movie for the cute bear characters, the funny antics of the humans, and the call to adventure. this is a perfect sunday afternoon family movie. there is a deeper underlying message here as well, but not nearly as effective or heartwarming as the original paddington. paddington earned 268 million, paddington 2 earned 226 million, and paddington in peru earned just 104 million. i guess the figures dont lie this installment is not nearly as good as its predecessors.",negative

"cowboy bebop is a truly postmodern show. not in the tired scream sense of selfawareness, but in its willingness to mix genres and blur boundaries. at the most basic level its a space western. but bebop is not content to be merely that, so there are added dashes of film noir, gothic horror, creaturefeature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, crime, romance, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, fatalism, optimism, buddybuddy stories, slapstick humour, parody just about every type of tale under the sun appears in some shape or form during bebops run. its a show where each episode really is different from the last. were it not for the recurring characters, it would be hard to believe that the brightlycoloured blaxploitation parody mushroom samba could possibly come from the same series as the bleakly violent real folk blues. the world that the series inhabits is distinctly postmodern, too space ships fly through hyperspace gates, but once on the ground their pilots fight with twentiethcentury handguns. scenic bays would look for all the world like they were taken from modernday japan were they not dwarfed by jupiter, the enormous gas giant looming in the sky like some enormous benevolent god. and the music tribal drums and chants give way to electronic pulses that give way to jazz sax and trumpets that give way to rock guitars that give way to blues harmonicas... composer yoko kanno faultlessly turns her hand to an eclectc selection of genres and instruments, ably backed up by her band, seatbelts. all of which sounds terribly impressive, but why on earth should you watch it? because, buddy, its one of the finest television shows ever made. i have to admit im not a big anime fan. most anime that makes it over here seems to be either about schoolgirls with supernatural powers who battle evil, or adolescent boys who for some convoluted reason wind up having to pilot big giant robots. and whilst im assured that shows such as escaflowne schoolgirls and magic and evangelion boys and robots are actually rather good, they completely fail to get my blood pumping. enter bebop. ultra cool spike, grumpy strategist jet, triggerhappy faye, nutball ed and intelligent dog ein are as far away from the usual brats and bots anime as you can possibly get. their motivation, too, is far from the usual anime fare. these guys arent bounty hunters because they want to fight crime and keep the peace all they want is a wad of cash, and bounty hunting seems like the best place to make big money fast. although they will do the right thing when pressed, they rarely forget their true motivation and if they do, their perpetual lack of food will soon remind them. life isnt easy, and when youre a bounty hunter its even harder. not that the crew of the spaceship bebop are onenote characters. as the series progresses, our initial assumptions about the characters are overturned. at first spike appears to be the cliched laidback slacker who just happens to be a mean jeetkundo fighter, but we then learn of his fall from the criminal underworld and of a loss that killed him emotionally. jets the obvious gruff authority figure, until we realise that he actually cares for the crew of the bebop as if they were his kids and seems to have dabbled in pot and psychadelic drugs when he was a teenager. fayes the usual feisty standoffish female lead but only because her amazingly tragic past makes her push away friends for fear that shell become attached to them. eds just some nutty kid until we meet her crazy father and realise that it could well be her deprived childhood that sent her over the edge. and ein? well sometimes its hard being a super intelligent welsh corgi on a ship where nobody appreciates you, you know? but not every episode is deathly serious the character development is mixed in perfectly with humour both light and dark, fistfights, shootouts, car chases, aerial fights, space battles and some of the lushest animation youll see in an animated tv series. and all of this spread over only 26 episodes. yes, many people espouse the old leave em wanting more line, but so few of them actually do it buffy the vampire slayer is the perfect example of a series that spends three or four years being topnotch tv then freefalls due to apparent apathy from both the cast and writers. bebop avoids this by wrapping every dangling plot thread up in just one season of television. and after the final jawdropping episode its quite clear that the series is most definitely over. never before or since have i seen a series of such astonishing variety, intelligence and style. ten out of ten.",positive

"and when i say i ... i mean a character in this. the main character one could say. and also i am talking about the first movie and the second one ... and the cliffhangers they had. of course i reckon those who have read the books might have known that already. i did not even know there existed books ... at least not when i first saw the ... first movie. back then the movie was notorious infamous even, for its sex scenes. nudity is one thing, but the first movie was borderline porn. as some pointed out back then, there were even frames that were showing ... more than others. which began with an oral scene on a plane. if that wet your appetite no pun intended, by all means be my guest and watch the first movie. i reckon it was the best one, with a beauty and the beast meets 50 shades of grey thing. of course it ended on a note where we didnt know what would happen with our female lead ... something that the second movie did too. damn those movies should be called die hard ... will the third one end on a cliffhanger too? or will it have a final resolution ... to bring it home? no pun intended. one thing is for sure please stop complaining about these movies after youve seen them and then telling everyone they should stop making them. the more you watch, the likelier it is that there will be more of this ... although i am not even sure if there is a fourth book? not that this would stop anyone from making another movie they are succesful, no matter what the rating says here. and i am proof of that too. i do watch a lot though, so what is your excuse? the nudity? the being able to talk about it after? maybe you just like to watch machos doing their thing ... a woman playing many sides ... but still being cliche as ... well the f word that is happening a lot here too! even though the doctor apparently is saying not to have intercourse ... well i guess if you are horny ... but what really makes her wet? by the way if you feel uncomfortable reading what i am writing, wait til you see what is in the movie. not as explicit as the first one, but still a lot of naked bodies rubbing and pushing and pumping and ... well you get the picture no pun intended. the story may be the weakest of them all, but at least it does concentrate on the three main characters we established ... even the hot mother is being sidetracked. this could be the end but as a character says she will do what she wants to do its up to her no pun or innuendo intended",negative
"its a really funny and clever show with likable but odd characters. as for why i rate is a 7 as opposed to 9 or 10, first, im not a fan of how disturbing it can get sometimes, almost feels like watching requiem for a dream with a comedic twist, but i think theyve moved away from the worst of that the past few seasons. second reason is due to how loud it can be. it seems like every episode they are yelling about something, i have to turn the volume down during those scenes. i suspect they thought this was needed to make up for the lack of background laughter as that was still common with other sitcoms when this started. now that people are used to the opposite, comedy shows that dont have background laughter and often arent constantly loud, they could also tone down this aspect of the show in my opinion.",positive
"actually i should be grateful to tom six thanks to him and his demented movie, i finally know where to draw my own personal line when it comes to tolerating cinematic smut! the ideal way to describe this movie is to simply write down as many synonyms for the word repulsive you can think of! so here goes the human centipede ii full sequence is revolting, sickening, disgusting, loathsome, degrading, nauseating, appalling, despicable, vile, heinous, nefarious and absolutely positively depraved! the first film already caused quite a bit of commotion and controversy because of its plot and a handful of shocking sequences, but i swear the original looks like a politically correct disney family flick compared to the totally messed up sequel! not only does the concept of creating a human centipede gets enlarged and illustrated a lot more graphically, also the characters and sub plots are much more perverted and insane than in first sequence. i realize this will sound as a recommendation to all the sick puppies amongst you, but this is truly one of the most repugnant movies ever made. in spite of the emphasis more than obviously lying on gore and shockfactor, i nevertheless have to admit that the film features a number of ingenious story lines and creative twists. the whole basic plot and set up, for example, is surprisingly inventive. the sequel considers the original film in fact as a purely fictional film and thus the events and unorthodox medical experiments of dr. heiter were never real. however, the protagonist of part two the obese and mentally handicapped midget named martin is addicted to watching this crazy movie and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating his very own and bigger human centipede. i cant deny that i find this idea intriguing as a starting point for a sequel. writerdirector tom six also generates a suitably grim and disturbing surrounding around pivot character martin. he lives with his mother but she hates martin with a passion. why? because her husband is in prison as martin couldnt keep his pedophilic nightly visits secret. martin works as a concierge in an underground parking lot where he captures his victims, but also bashes peoples heads in with a crowbar and masturbates using sandpaper! he brings his centipede victims all 12 of them, including a very pregnant woman to a raunchy hangar and accomplishes his dream, which leads to many gross tableaux, i assure you. multiple images that i cant even begin to describe truly give a whole new meaning to the words tasteless and immoral. when approaching the grand finale, you may expect scenes featuring excrement, rape, miscarriage and gratuitous torturemutilation. dont even consider watching the human centipede ii not even out of curiosity if you have a bit of virtue left inside yourself. laurence r. harvey gives away a peculiar and remarkable performance as martin. he is so convincingly perverted and deviant that i sincerely doubt if hes even a normal person in real life... i dont want to know him at least, thats for sure. the film is entirely shot in black and white, which perhaps makes the gruesomeness and on screen filth slightly more digestible, but primarily it increases the sober and grim atmosphere of it all. other elements that contribute to this are the minimal use of dialogs andor soundtrack and the nihilistic narrative tone. it maybe feels weird to admit, but technically speaking the human centipede ii is actually a competent effort. apparently theres already a third installment in the making, but i might just spare myself the hideous aftertaste in my mouth and stomach.",negative
sometimes a film comes along and the timing of its release turns out to be absolutely perfect and in my opinion this is one of those films. everything about this film feels right and it is nearly two hours of inventive comedy and pretty much anything else you would want from a really entertaining creation. all of the people involved in the making of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. i always enjoy watching it again and i will never lose my enthusiasm for this film. the film could have been released five years before or five years after 1985 and for some reason i do not think it would have had the same effect. we will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and therefore works remarkably well. i would recommend this film to anyone providing they are prepared to tune into the humour and if that happens it will be guaranteed to be an enjoyable experience.,negative

"mickey 17 had the potential to be an innovative scificomedy film, and it starts off in an engaging and original way. however, as the story progresses, it loses focus and ultimately turns into something generic, with an uninspired and rushed conclusion. robert pattinson delivers a solid and wellrounded performance, proving his versatility even in a film that leans more towards comedy something outside his usual genre. despite the lighter tone, pattinson brings depth to his character, making the story feel more grounded and adding an emotional layer to the film that otherwise would feel empty. cloning is a fascinating subject for a scifi movie because of all the moral and practical dilemmas it presents. mickey 17 introduces these ideas but doesnt fully engage in them, shifting focus to a less compelling storyline midway through the creepers. it feels out of the place compared to the films promising start and even the trailers the initial mix of humor and originality is lost, and by the end, the movie feels like it was hurriedly wrapped up just to deliver something, lacking any real creativity or impact. that said, the film excels in its production design. the setting and character outfits are wellcrafter, adding to the immersive scifi atmosphere. additionally, the visual effects are compelling, bringing the futuristic world to life in a convincing and visually stunning way, which helps maintain engagement even when the story fails to do so.",positive

"the film is about a crazy lady and her henchmen who are trying to create supergenius babies in controlled laboratory conditions. at the same time, identical twins are being raised outside the lab in order to determine if dr. kinders thats a subtle name teaching methods create significantly smarter babies. but, one of the babies in particular is a lot smarter than the doctor and her henchmen and spends much of the movie hiding or attacking these folksin a muchdumbed down version of babys day out. and, when the supergenius baby meets up with the identical twins, he mobilizes them into an elite fighting force. there are several types of bad movies. one are the ed woodstyle bad movies such as manos hands of fate, eegah! and the beast of yucca flats. they are ultralow budget and cant help but suck. with absolutely nothing going for them, you expect these movies to be terrible and usually theyre a lot of fun to watch because they are so ineptly made. the second are movies that are vacuous but have reasonably large budgets, such as the awful from justin to kelly, car 54 where are you? and disaster movie. these are occasionally watchable but generally hurt your brain with the stupidity of it all...and they cant blame the budget for the film being that bad! the third type, and baby geniuses is chief among them is like the secondthere is a reasonable budget but the films manage to do something normal bad movies dontthey are so annoying, so grating that you want to hurt those responsible for making them please dont...no matter how tempting it might be! baby geniuses is a terrible film that made me ill just to watch it. about the only film that caused as intense a visceral reaction was jerry lewis cracking up. with respected and semirespected hollywood talent in the film, the only thing that might explain their being in this crapfest is if the film makers had kidnapped loved ones in order to force people like kathleen turner and christopher lloyd to star in the movie! why? because the basic idea is so dumb and so appealing, you cant see how the actors would have agreed to be in the film as for peter macnicol and dom deluise, this is a story right up their alley and i can see why they appeared in this film. plus, even if the actors werent turned off by the story idea, the dialog must have shouted suckfest as soon as they saw the scripts! phrases such as diaper gravy poop pepper the film in a pathetic attempt at humor. and who could think that the following dialog is funny or remotely appropriate for all audiences? 1st babytake off your clothes. 2nd babywell at least you can buy me dinner first. however, if you think watching toddlers do kung fu, punching adults in the crotch too many times to count, dancing to disco tunes, or many pop culture references, then this film is for youas is its hilarious sequel yes, there is a sequelmaking me wonder a loving god could allow such a film to be made. imagine, if you can, look whos talking, babys day out, the great escape and 102 dalmatians all merged into one film and written by particularly stupid and obnoxious 6 yearoldsthis is baby geniusesand it clearly has earned its place on imdbs esteemed bottom 100the 100 lowest rated films of all time. by the way, although this was far from the worst part of the film, if you saw this pile of diaper gravy, didnt you wonder how it was that the supersuper genius baby was able to make all these pop cultural references? how could a kid raised in perfect conditions in the lab know about the three stooges, the jerry springer show or terminator?!",positive

"a movie should aim to awaken the viewers emotions, whether it be love, sadness, excitement, or a blend of feelings. la vita bella is a film that delves deep into ones emotions and touches the soul in a profound way. roberto benignis oscarwinning performance truly marked his career, with every line delivered full of excitement and joy. the phrase buongiorno principessa, repeated throughout the film with increasing joviality, becomes a signature moment, as benigni expresses it each time with both his body and heart. at its core, la vita bella is about the fight for greater good in the face of overwhelming adversity. while the holocaust serves as the backdrop, the film is not strictly about this tragic event. instead, it explores the universal struggle to preserve dignity, love, and hope even in the darkest times. guidos strong character is established early on when he persistently pursues the woman he loves, using his wit and charm to win her heart. this same determination and strength of character are later mirrored in his actions during the holocaust, where his fight is not just for survival but for the preservation of his sons innocence and humanity. lifes journey, especially when intertwined with an unfair and invidious system, often challenges and changes ones ideals. however, guidos life motto, as reflected in the films title, remains steadfast. the movie effectively shows how injustice can disrupt ones love life and the upbringing of a family, but it cannot lead to personal degradation if one is rooted in strong morals. a good role happens when an actor fully understands the directors vision. a perfect one happens when the actor is directing himself. this is a mustwatch in a mustwatch list.",positive

"over the weekend, i had a chance to visit with korean filmmaker director, mr.shim hyung rae here in korea, home to the yonggu arts and entertainment company. as we toured the rather spacious digital production studios located in a secluded area near kimpo airport , i got a sense of what really happens behind the scenes during the post production phased of a cgi film. dwars the title of his latest movie and dragon war props appeared everywhere and were used in several sequences of the scifi thriller, five years in the making . although i knew that shim hyungrae had a reputation that preceded him, i could not help but wonder if dwar was simply a remake of his previous movie aptly called reptilian. after the first five minutes into the extended preview of dwar however, i knew that such conceptions i had of a boring remake was not only far fetched but a misnomer. the way computer science and technology are mastered here made it perfectly clear that the director has come a long , long way from reptilian, a very low grossing film. not only does mr. shim succeed in the use of a real plot this time but he casts real american actors not to mention a compelling drama that takes us back 500 years to a period of ancient history known as the chosun dynasty. but the directors message is just as relevant as it works it way through to present day los angeles. even mr. shim himself is convinced that hes no longer a mediocre film maker as he plys his trade as a creative tourdeforce in directing cgi films. will dwar defy any other description other than a blockbuster ? that question remains to be answered since the movie is set to be released this summer when we all get the chance to experience the absolute conquest of mankind . i did breathe a sigh of relief during a private screening and i was able to see some familiar faces on the big screen. the movie cast includes american actors such as dreamy jason behr and the hero ethan kendricks who must save los angeles from an army of atrox soldiers. i figured most of the atrox droids,clad in black armour were probably cheaper by the dozen to hire but as i found out later they were not hired extras but life size figures that were made from heavy metals and stored safely for future takes ! that was enough to convince me that there seemed to be a greater magnitude to this scifi flick than meets the eye. theres even a newborn baby that appears all too real but she too was made from an incredibly realistic computer rendered model. i took careful production notes about the advanced computer animation process that was used and i was also shown how the crying baby was preserved in glass and an exact replica of someones first born. as we winded up the tour, the most pressing question in my mind was what becomes a legend most for mr. shim, a long time veteran in the film making business who has made over 20 films. the answer seemed to emanate from his most ambitious project the imoogis of course! thats a korean word for a mythical creature that evolved over time and its in d war that the imoogi attempts to morph into a defiant dragon. in closing, id rate d war a solid b for its exciting visuals and explosive scenes that keeps a pace all its own. also in production for mr. shims next movies are goseong legend and a computer animation feature based on the life of myriad fishes in the sea. annong ! irene nakano harvard u. film studies email me yonsei mac.com",negative

"city lights is a film which is beloved and revered. and it is easy to see why. as comedies go, it may not be among the funniest films ever made. but if there is any shortfall of laughs the film more than compensates with an overabundance of charm. and it is not as if the film is totally lacking in laughs either, there is plenty of good humor here. but in this case it is the story, more than the jokes and gags, which really is the key to the films success. that story draws you in, makes you root for charlie chaplins famous tramp. its a beautifully unique love story which will definitely bring a smile to your face and ultimately maybe even a tear to your eye. city lights is the brilliant result you get when you have a master of his art form at work. the simple, though thoroughly captivating story, follows the tramp as he falls in love with a beautiful, blind flower girl. she cant see him for the lowly hobo he is, a misunderstanding upon her initial meeting leads her to believe he is a wealthy gentleman. the tramp is more than happy to allow her to maintain that illusion. he gets some help in this endeavor from a drunken millionaire who befriends him. the tramp gets money from the millionaire, stays in his house, drives his car. all very helpful in keeping up the ruse of wealthiness for the blind girl. unfortunately the drunken millionaire is only friends with the tramp whenever he is in fact drunk. when he sobers up he doesnt remember the tramp at all. this of course causes awkward, and funny, complications. meanwhile the flower girl has problems of her own. shes behind on the rent and, unknowingly since her grandmother hides the notice, about to be evicted. the tramp is determined to save the day, pay the rent and also somehow pay for surgery to cure the girls blindness. how will our shabby little hero pull this off? chaplin is a master of his craft at the peak of his powers. when city lights was released the era of silent films was at its end, the talkies had taken over. but chaplin was determined to tell his story his way, really the only way a story of the tramp could ever be told. who would want to hear the tramp speak? the brilliance of the character is in the pantomime, the expressions. chaplin tugs on the heartstrings without ever saying a word. other performers in the film, most notably virginia cherrill as the blind girl and harry myers as the millionaire, play their parts well. cherrill in particular deserves much credit for the films ultimate emotional wallop. but this film is chaplins through and through, his fingerprints are on every frame. a brilliant performer, a brilliant director. every moment is so well thought out. maybe the film is not outrageously funny but there is plenty of humor to appreciate. even if you think a scene may drag on too long, like a boxing match late on in the film, you cant help but appreciate the effort that went into it. it may be a little long but the scene is undeniably worked out beautifully, chaplin showing an absolute mastery of choreography. it is a comedy film in which ultimately the comedy is secondary. yes, there are jokes and gags and no, not all of them work perfectly. but there are definitely enough good comedic moments to keep you entertained. but more importantly there is a story to keep you enthralled. the love story between the tramp and the blind girl warms your heart and makes city lights a true feelgood movie, one worthy of its status as one of the most beloved films ever made.",positive

"some like it hot is a great comedy. it seemed to be a bit racy for being made in the late 50s, but maybe thats why it is so popular. the humor in this movie is clever and witty. minus the wardrobe, the music and the look of the cars, it seems like it would be a movie made today, mainly because of the timeless humor. the story line is also very good. the viewer is hooked from the beginning and is on the edge of their seat until the very end. joe is the undeniable ladies man that plays the sax and jerry is the paranoid bass player. they take the ride of their lives to save their lives from the mob. they put themselves in a situation that not too many men would be upset about. but jealousy, lies and the fact that they are men gets in the way, causing much humor. the acting in this movie is the best thing about it. tony curtis and jack lemmon have a great chemistry and are very believable as best friends. then throw marilyn monroe in the mix and youve got a great group of actors with great chemistry. all of the main characters acted with such ease and the parts just seemed to come so naturally to them.",positive

"a pointedly grounded road trip dramedy that is bestknown nowadays for the performance of kieran culkin who indeed deserves all the acclaim for this role. writerdirectoractor eisenberg knows he is outshone by his costar and the script gives most of the big moments to culkin with eisenberg strategically held back for the more devastating ones like the sudden monologue late night in the restaurant. in general, the script is very effective at imbuing small moments with much larger significance the most notable example is likely the extended scene with photos at the soldier memorial. there are also the simple yet effective sound choices the pair lands and departs at the chopin airport, so 90 of the soundtrack consists of chopin. the key exception is the magdanek death camp visit the entire scene is completely devoid of music, just as it is suddenly void of conversation and is only punctuated by short, monosyllabic comments from the previouslyverbose tour guide. if there is a flaw, its that the script at times feels too biased towards culkins benji. literally everybody on the tour ends up genuinely praising him in some way by the end, which can feel stilted, and genuine enmity from even one person would have been more plausible. benji is also the avatar of dirtbag marxism and the script prefers to undermine it indirectly through showing us the hypocrisy of his positions such as with the train joyride which frankly stretches plausibility way too far to make a point. the older couple on the tour could have made an interesting foil for a charged conversation or two about the merits of capitalism but the script really underutilizes them compared to every other character. still, these points are fairly minor. altogether, it makes far more out of its premise then i would have thought. while i have not seen most of the other best picture contenders yet, i would not mind if this one somehow wins the grand prize. and not just the virtually assured best supporting actor.",positive

"can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever? answer yes, and this is one of them. after helming the appalling house of the dead director uwe boll has now cast his lessthantalented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. dont these guys get it? to anyone who cant understand, here it is in block capitals for you video games do not make for good movies! the acting here is, at best, substandard. the set design and special effects are poor. unlike the video game which did have its scary moments the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. the main culprit is the director. uwe boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored. why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets. avoid at all costs.",negative
jeepers creepers reborn was absolutely horrible. it had all the characteristics of a lowbudget movie. you could tell when a green screen was used. the acting and cgi were horrible. i do not understand what the vision was for this specific movie. the director spoke at the beginning of the movie and said production was halted due to covid19 but then continued later. it is appalling to think they had more time on this movie and this was the end result. this truly was an unnecessary addition to the franchise and pales in comparison to the previous jeepers creepers movies. i would not recommend this movie to anyone.,negative

"if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews, please follow my blog living in portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. the price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city every time i want to watch a movie on imax or dolby atmos, its a financial effort and timeconsuming and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films arent released in their original date, especially novemberdecember oscarbait movies. only now i had the opportunity to see green book, and i am so mad i wasnt able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedydrama of last year and one of the best overall! with the help of a terrific cast, peter farrelly and his writing crew which counts with vallelongas son, nick deliver what i think is the best screenplay of 2018. i cant remember the last time i cried of so much laughter in a film. i cant remember the last time i did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. this comedydrama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions i wasnt expecting, at all. i went in anticipating outstanding performances check and solely that. since 2019 has already begun, im watching the oscarbait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed. however, green book completely took me by surprise. i genuinely dont know why everyone was so shocked when it won best screenplay at the golden globe awards. it possesses such a wellwritten story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. it takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. its an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. its not more of the same, its not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some oscar nominations. its a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions. nevertheless, this wellstructured, beautifullydirected and cleverlywritten film would be just good if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. viggo mortensen and mahershala ali have such compelling chemistry that i wouldnt mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. i knew mortensen had a humorous side to him, but i never saw this coming! his timing, his expressions, his italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. he absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time i had at a film theater in a long time, and his oscar nomination is more than fair. he made a 130min feature movie feel like a short flick. ali doesnt come far behind. obviously, since viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that hes just there to help his costar shine, but he does much more than that. since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. however, once shirley starts getting along with tony lip, ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. hes definitely a supporting actor, but god is he a phenomenal one! linda cardellini dolores vallelonga, even though shes only onscreen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance. tony lip and dr. don shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. each characters arc is brilliantly illustrated by peter farrelly, who gradually shows how tony and don are changing their view of the world and of each others culture. either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right. technically, farrelly controls the movies pacing exceptionally well, by making a twohourish film feel like half of it. remarkablybalanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. consistentlyfilmed and welledited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. nevertheless, this isnt a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. farrelly only needed to do ok with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and thats exactly what he did. finally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... see how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which dont have a single thing to do with the movie itself? i dont care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. i dont care if someone misinterprets viggo mortensens speech about racism. i dont care if the family of don shirley doesnt like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. i dont care if the story isnt 100 true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. so, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create. green book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. one of the best comedydramas ive seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. peter farrelly and his fellow cowriters delivered a seamlesslywritten story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. viggo mortensen and mahershala ali deliver awardworthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. i thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an a, but guess what ...",positive
"this show has provided me a similar experience and marvelous miss maisel. both were genres and subject matter i had little interest in, but after watching a few episodes the writing and acting were so good i got hooked. there really is nothing about this premise that appeals to me but it just pulled me in and the two leads are really great. hannah einbinder has really accomplished something remarkable in my opinion. i think i had initially made an assumption that her character would be cringeworthy but she has such a well developed three dimensional character ive really enjoyed her. shes awkward, yet somehow gorgeous, smart and confident yet vulnerable and flawed, precocious yet humble. by the end of this current season, i find myself so invested in her. the supporting cast is also growing on me but especially kayla who i adored right away and its really satisfying allowing her to evolve and not feel compelled to keep her as the cartoonish persona she had early on. i get the biggest kick out of her and the actress is such a force of nature. i smile every time she comes on screen. as for jean smart. i just believe her. i believe this person exists and that they behave the way she does. shes evolving too but without losing the core of her persona in an unrealistic way.",positive

"curious about the man often referred to as the modern day edward wood jr., my friends and i decided to watch our first uwe boll movie. unfortunately, the only one i could get for a dollar was bloodrayne ii, and one of my friends objected to watching a sequel without having seen the original, so he went to blockbuster to rent the first one. three hours of incompetence is far too much, as you must imagine. the first one doesnt, in fact, rank as one of the worst movies ive ever seen. its poor, to be sure, but there was enough cleavage and gory violence to keep at least the juvenile part of my mind a huge part of my total mind, to be perfectly honest! engaged. bloodrayne is a medieval action movie about a half vampire gal kristen loken, from terminator 3 looking to kill her father ben kingsley, the vampire ruler who raped and killed her mother. she joins up with a secret society whose purpose it is to exterminate vampires led by michael madsen, matt davis and michelle rodriguez. also in this far too accomplished cast are billy zane, udo kier, geraldine chaplin and meat loaf credited as meatloaf aday. as with most of uwe bolls movies, this one is based on a video game. but apparently he or the studio or the screenwriter or whoever decided that the games fans, the only ones who would probably be interested in seeing the movie anyway, werent worth pleasing, because the games take place in like the 1940s or something the little bit i saw of it had cars, anyway, and this one takes place in medieval times, i guess because the time period is hot or something because of the lord of the rings movies. the whole movie seems lazy. the look on every actors face is that one that says, give me my paycheck! sometimes they attempt a britishsounding accent, but that comes and goes. it doesnt look at all like the film had an action choreographer. the violence during the action sequences is delightfully nasty. if you can giggle at poorly done decapitations and dismemberment, those parts of the movie are moderately fun. but much of the film just has the characters standing around talking, and it gets really boring.",negative
"maybe this was an important movie and thats why people rank it so highly, but honestly it isnt very good. in hindsight its easy to see that chaplin probably all of hollywood was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos, so you cant fault him too much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnect remains. more disappointingly, the movie is just clunky its as if chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era. the set pieces, those involving both the jewish barber and the dictator, dont flow into each other they just sit there like discrete lumps of storyline that progress in fits and starts, moving somewhere but never arriving at resolution. some are funny, some less so. what charm the movie has is strictly in the person of chaplin himself. his parodies of hitlers speeches were the best part of the whole thing, and theres no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch. but virtually everything he surrounded himself with was annoying. hannah was too damn american. the storm troopers were too damn american. oooh! oooh! one more thing! i dont know what purpose was served by having garbage be the source of evil behind the throne. it almost seems like the film is saying that, if it werent for malign influences like garbage, hynckle wouldnt have been that bad a guy.",positive
"an accusation that can be convincingly levelled at scorsese, especially in his weaker moments, is that he wants to have his cake and eat it. is he celebrating, lampooning, or critiquing alpha masculinity... or is he doing some combination of all three? in the later part of his career this film is the prime example of that im never quite sure where he lands, and i dont think he truly is either. theres some brilliant performances and one scene between margot robbie and dicaprio towards the end is genuinely upsetting. but the relentless, frenetic pace of much of the previous three hours does seem to dwarf that not to mention what comes after it. three hours of that pace of editing and that volume of sound is just too much and there seems to be a bit too much comedic enjoyment gained from morally reprehensible behaviour to convince the film is sufficiently nuanced. not to say there isnt plenty to admire and enjoy but by scorseses standards this leaves the wrong kind of taste in the mouth.",positive
"the thing is, this movie probably deserves a 3 instead of the one i gave it. the reason is that its so bad, it gets you thinking. thinking about the nature of film and music and how morons get the money to make movies etc. also, imagine if a good director was instructed to make a movie this as bad as it is. i can imagine it because this almost looks like a plot to ruin mariahs career hey wasnt her husband a bigwig that she dumped?! i think what would happened most times is the director would see this cut and think no, no, i have to make this better, nobody is going to believe a movie could unintentionally be this bad. you also get a few good laughs just at how obvious and obtuse the whole thing is. why then, did i have it a 1? well, i consider a big film like this turning out this horrid to be a small crime. one where the wealthy people involved should be fined. mariah should have given her paycheck to charity its the only ethical thing to do given the cultural atrocity this movie represents.",negative

i just had to setup an imdb account to leave a review on this film. i cannot even begin to describe how bad this film is. ive never thought that adam sandler was that funny but he has reduced himself to flump quality after this. what on earth was my hero............robert deniro doing in this film also? has he got a chronic drug habit and needed quick cash? it was degrading for him to be in this. surely a man of his qualities saw and read the script before agreeing to this dogfart of a film. im not going to go over the plot as too many others have before me. this is a simple review to say do not watch. you will be wasting your time........but actually........yes........do watch it just to confirm how bad it is!,negative
"in my view, two reasons were effective in making this series popular and loved, firstly, the script and dialogues, which were written with great detail, and secondly, the unique acting of the six main characters who played very well. although the atmosphere of the series usually takes place between a cafe and an apartment, the series itself is so great that this point is not important at all. each part can be seen separately and all the parts can be linked together. it is impossible to say which character was better because all six characters were complementary. the comedy of the situation of the series and the laughs also helped to make the series funnier. unpleasant events, discomforts, and problems were also seen in the series, and sometimes there was a balance between laughter and crying, and it was very touching.",positive
"hugh jackman is the perfect wolverine. what a fun movie. i like the dialogue and clever quips with f bombs sprinkled in. its definitely not taking itself too seriously. there is tons of fun cameos i didnt expect! i normally watch spoiler videos ahead of time, but i didnt on this occasion and im glad i didnt because there was some oh snap moments! its a very good action packed fun film. the breaking the fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. i can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon. they are promoting this movie hard i just watched these two on hot ones eating chicken wings they make a dynamic duo. until your 90 wolverine ...until your 90 lol.",positive
"its great to see a program that shows the reality of farming in the uk, how difficult it can be for all of the farmers not just jeremy. it also highlights the petty mindedness of people in local authorities and how they can ruin a business, because clearly the local council jeremy has to deal with have a personal beef with him and are unwilling to see the bigger picture, one word... jobsworths! overall the show is just total entertainment that is on par with game of thrones and any other top series out there simply through the characters themselves, their love of the land and farming and just educational at the same time. totally love it and can watch it over and over again.",positive
"i have dont think ive ever seen such a load of rubbish, i have no idea what the story line is, lets me honest there is no story line, the acting is terrible and its like 10 films in one??? i am still no wiser as to what has happened, at least the first film had a story line, this is just a joke.",negative
season 1 is a gem. the writing and acting is amazing. i cant wait for every sunday evening. i wish i wouldnt have started it so i could binge watch the hole thing. there are parts that it takes a few seconds for your brain to process and then bang omg laugh out loud funny. rewind watch again funny. the story telling is masterful. only thing wrong with this show is cant find anything to its equal wile waiting for the next one to be released. now that the next one is being released im going to wait and watch it when its all done this is a show that is hard to wait for every sunday so ill be patient and just binge watch it.,positive
"let me start by a warning, if you are easily offended, super religious, a prude or hate laughter this is not the show for you.... dont watch it, dont review it you will not like it. adam devine is hilarious plan and simple... im not the big fan of danny mcbride simply because i think is acting range is limited. with that said this part was made for him. john goodman is his classic self. edi patterson is gutbusting funny. im from a southern state so this hits close to home and is mostly true. the writing is light, funny and entertaining..... my one single complaint is that the season was only 10 episodes!!! it will leaving wanting more.",positive
"billy wilders the apartment is his greatest accomplishment. it is his most successful melding of comedy and drama that he never quite pulled off again. im glad the academy had enough good taste to award wilder the triple crown best picturedirectorscreenplay. but they still had enough bad taste to deny jack lemmon a best actor award, shirley maclaine a best actress award and fred macmurray a nomination and award. the plot this time c.c. baxter lemmon in case youre wondering c for calvin c for clifford, but most people call me budlends out his apartment to executives for their extramarital trysts in the faint hope of a promotion. eventually, his boss, sheldrake macmurray, excellent in a rare straight role finds out and wants the key for his own affairs. meanwhile, baxter has a crush on miss kubelik maclaine, in a strong performancethe elevator operator. for those who accuse me of spoiling the whole movie rest assured. this only covers the first 20 minutes or so of the 126 minute feature. wilder has many twists and tricks up his sleeve and ill leave you to discover what happens. what amazes me about the apartment is that unlike most films, this isnt about the plot. its a study in human nature and the mistakes they make. that is a strong trait of most wilder films including kiss me, stupid and the fortune cookie, both hilarious comedies with a hidden meaning also the dialogue by wilder and i.a.l. diamond isnt just oneliners although they are funny especially when spoken by lemmon and ray walstonthere is real heartfelt sentiment here and it isnt the syrupy kind that makes my stomach churn as in films like patch adams wilder allows enough to make his points and then gets back to comedy. the cinematography is fabulous too. wilders film as most of his 60s films is in widescreen black and white shot by joseph lashelle, in panavision one of the most unsung and unrecognized cinematographers in history, he was nominated but lost it has a crisp,clean look and is one of the few widescreen films that actually make the viewer feel confined in a tight space. the apartment is a superior example of the serious comedy, films that work as both comedy and drama. sadly, many of todays filmmakers have lost touch with this genre. i cant help but feel that the freedoms granted today that werent in the 1950s and 60s havent been an advance. theyve been holding us back. smart characters have lost way to stupid and oversexed ones. thats a real shame and its high time we go back to our roots. out of 4 stars",positive
"have i ever been more bored in my life? the answer is probably no. lets kick things off with the production of this film because i think this is pretty necessary. this hopelessness of a film has been in production since 1999, and several different studios have been working on it, if that already tells you that quite a few people have gave up on it whats the point on watching it? thats what some people knew because it only got 75,000 back from a 65,000,000 budget, so obviously it was a flop. foodfight, was also denounced from taking product placement, which couldve got them more money, to make it better! the studio that made this atrocious film also decided to get it out as quickly as possible since some of the characters in the poster werent in the actual film. geez! another reason to back this up is that the ending where the main character proposes to his girlfriend is really rushed, this couldve been a good scene but it was wasted by the studio who wanted to get it out quickly and get some money, which they didnt do. there were quite a few famous actors in this film such as charlie sheen however one member of the cast shocked me quite a bit christopher lloyd as mr. clipboard. his acting in my favorite film ever back to the future was breathtaking and in this he was breathtakingly bad, how can he do this? i believe he should stay with acting because his voice acting was awful. plus, what kind of name is mr. clipboard its insulting to say that the creators have no imagination with that name. charlie sheen is another fantastic actor, what a disappointment from him. all his lines were dull, even if the writer wrote them like that, he couldve put some energy into his lines, unfortunately, he didnt and thats what made crap like this. the final voice actor who baffled me was hilary duff, the actor who played lorraine baker in cheaper by the dozen. she portrayed sunshine and made the character sound like a 5 year old, this was ridiculous! judging by this film all of these actorsactress shouldnt be voice acting. on the subject of voice acting in general, it was dull and lifeless it made the whole film drag. during this film, there were a few speeches and somehow they were loathsome, speeches are supposed to get you hyped not bored! if i could use two phrases to sum up this film they would be simple and plain and its a trap, yes a star wars quote in this crap, and i hated it! the final thing im going to say in this paragraph is about the cheesy one liners, because it feels like youre having a cringe attack when you hear them, theyre so dull and the way theyve been said is ghastly. one of the main monstrosities of this film was the animation, google it now because it looks like it was from a playstation 2 game and it was made in 2012! if the production history didnt scare you well the animation will because its horrendous! another thing about this film is that its 100 dull, none of its interesting, if i told my brother to watch this hell watch about 15 minutes of it and turn it off, its that boring, ive sat through a few boring movies but this one is the worst. one of the reasons why this film is so boring is because its really unfunny, i had more laughs out of superbabies than this, and i think i laughed about once in 90 minutes, that makes me feel depressed. another reason why this is so boring is the fact that the plot was so basic. i can say it in 9 words evil nazis take over shop, heroes must fight them. thats the plot. ill let you take some time to realize how poor it is. atrociously bad. you may be thinking why i said nazis and im going to tell you now the evil organization is called brand x and their characters and strategies are a strong resemblance to the nazis, the evil woman whose name i cant remember is strangely like hitler because shes good at speeches, has a very good manipulation strategy and back in 1945 hitler was a handsome bloke apparently, and this evil woman was no exception, she was made to look good. even her henchmen had slight german accents and were crazy, one of them reminded me of joseph goebbels, and not good who ever made this diabolical film. as i mentioned before the imaginative creators gave some really good names such as rex dogtective! what a lousy and ridiculous name, even i could call the main character something better, for example jeff or buster. you see a dogs name with a detective meaning i am better than these creators, but to be honest, its not hard. on the same subject, in this film the lead role becomes a general? because he starts to formulate plans like a general does but hes a detective? its a bloody complicated movie in my head. one final reason why this film was bad is because it had really bad sex jokes in it you may be thinking sex jokes in a kids movie? this has been done before and as an example, shrek has quite a few but not this bad. again, these jokes make me cringe and question the world. there are a few other reasons why this film is bad but i dont want to milk it. so heres the final paragraph, the conclusion. i believe this film was a waste of time, money and effort. ive already explained why and i just want to get to the next movie because i really cant be bothered talking about this movie. i want to forget about it 0.610.",negative
"mystery science theater, if you are reading this ... may i suggest battlefield earth for one of your episodes! i guarantee you, youll have a field day with this one! there are enough bad elements of this film to keep the man and his robots speaking continuously throughout the film... ... just be sure not to get cricks in your necks from the diagonal camera angles. the producers and directors of this film need to drink their v8s before filming in the future. in summary, the plot inconsistencies to numerous to mention, wanton disregard for basic scientific principles, and lack of philosophical coherency ... no there is no hidden depth in this film ... it is just plain bad!!!! results in a rating of 14 stars out of 4. believe me, that is being generous to the worst film i have ever seen in my entire life!",negative

"i guess we can get the bad out of the way the production is very cheap, the heros costume and the makeup on the main villain and a few other important characters are not very convincing. the plot is more than a little condensed from the source material, which makes captain america seem like a not very good hero. even a short montage of his exploits in world war ii could have helped set him up as a better hero. also a lot of the cast really overact. the good ronny cox and ned beatty do not simply phone in their performances, and they carry their scenes exceptionally well. matt salinger, as the titular captain america and his altar ego, does have an aw shucks likability that helps him fit into the all american nature of the character. the script does not give him much to work with, but he is likeable and sells the man out of time aspect really well. lastly, despite being mostly shot in yugoslavia, the filming manages to sell a variety of locations very well. the silly fun some of the editing and special effects will illicit presumably unintentional laughs, and those laughs will up the enjoyability factor. despite some actors overacting not being very good, darren mcgavin and scott paulin are both clearly having a blast playing deliciously evil characters. on the whole, captain america 1990 is not a great film, but it is enjoyable. and if you are in the right mood, will make for a fun tuesday night in front of the tv.",positive

"with just two episodes released, the studio is already shaping up to be one of the greatest satirical comedies of all time. if the rest of the series maintains this level of wit, and perfectly timed humor, it could easily earn goat status. the writing is clever, the pacing is tight, and every joke lands with precision. seth rogen delivers a hilarious performance. the satire is on point. the way it skewers the entertainment industry is both brilliant and refreshing, exposing its absurdity in the funniest way possible. its smart, bold, and unafraid to take risksexactly what great satire should be. if this momentum continues, the studio could be a gamechanger in the genre.",positive

"going to a small island for a party, a group of revelers finds the entire area overrun by vicious flesheating zombies raised from the dead by a deadly chemical and must find a way of stopping the creatures and getting off the island alive. this is an unfairly maligned zombie effort that has a lot going for it. one of the better features here is the rather impressive suspense built up here, whether done through the jungle location where its all set up in the traditional gloomy, oppressive jungle shrubs that really give off a great vibe or the opening scenes of the chaosriddled party that doesnt strike as being odd and offthewall enough to really warrant that kind of attention which pays off in a rather tense beginning. compounding it all as well is the films singular best quality in its relentless action that pretty much runs throughout the film as a whole, initially serving as the perfect payoff for the suspensefilled opening while offering up plenty of exciting moments. theres plenty of action here that starts off with the attacks in the forest filled with oncoming swarms of zombies that are appearing behind trees and underwater all along a rather fun and exciting series of chases and encounters. the main part of the excitement here is the centerpiece assault on the group as they race into the shack which is readily filled with tons of blasting gunshots, zombies heads blasts apart, limbs hacked off and martial arts moves all being utilized against the zombies in a delirious tenminute plus sequence that also manages to feature tons of stuntwork and gory action to make for a spectacular highlight. other big action scenes include the final battle in the house where the reanimated bodies all start coming back to life in the lab while the battle in the tunnel features some creepy zombie makeup and leads into the thrilling sword fight at the finale. along with that fantastic zombie makeup and fun gore, these are enough to build this up against the few flaws here, which include the continuous videogame sequences in the middle of a random scene which is quite aggravating for the quantity of times its done and the selection of scenes it showcases. theyre distracting, dont fit the tone of whats happening and seem to be done merely to placate fans of the game. the only other flaw here is the decision to utilize the running zombie tactics thats just completely unrelated to anything in the film that were given as to the source of their resurrection. these here are the films only real flaws that hold it down. rated r graphic violence, graphic language, nudity, and drug use.",negative

"mike white, the director writer of the white lotus is not everybodys cup of tea. but if you get his dark, twisted humor you will love this new show. very promising start. great characters, excellent actors and a tropical paradise vacation which took the wrong turn. even if you are in a beautiful place, you cannot escape yourself. perfect show for summer to remind us that even though we all long for a change of scenery after months of lockdown, some vacations can go horribly wrong. what i very much like is that the stories are twisted and dark, but still realistic and human.",positive

"ive never written a movie review before but after watching this, i felt obligated to perform a public service. if its any indication, my 4 year old daughter left the room 15 minutes in, i suspect she found it too immature. i lasted another 10 minutes due to the fact that im not nearly as mature as most 4 year olds before i turned it off. this is not the worst movie ever made, that movie was substantially better than this one. you have been warned. this line is filler because my review does not meet the 10 line requirement. i tried keeping this short because watching the show has wasted enough of my time already. hopefully i can spare you some of yours.",negative

"okay, so if you are looking to kill a rainy saturday inside by watching a movie and this one is on take my advice and skip it!!!!!!!!! there are some movies which fall into the so bad they are good category, like showgirls, duel in the sun, etc. gigli is not one such film. it has the reputation of being one of the worst films of all time, and that reputation is welldeserved. usually, i can sit through a movie at least once even if i hate it. this is one movie that i could not sit through. an afternoon in the dentists chair is more appealing to me than watching this film, and i am not kidding. the issues with this film are numerous, and have been welldocumented. one, is the complete lack of chemistry between the two leads. considering that they were a megacouple at the time and inspired one of the most famous couple names of all time, youd think jlo and affleck would actually have chemistry onscreen. well, you would think so, but you would be very, very wrong. its been years since bennifer was a thing, but the two have zero chemistry as a couple onscreen and you have to wonder where their supposed passionate love affair was reflected, because theres no sign of it here. the title is another issue. for years, i thought the name of this was giggly. well, color me surprised when i found out it was not! live and learn. im not sure why exactly two oscar winning actors like pacino and walken are in this film. did they lose a bet? did they need money at the time? did they not read the script before agreeing to be in this? i found myself pondering these questions so much that i could not even focus on the film itself although judging by what other people have said, i didnt really miss too much. i cannot help but feel sorry for director martin brest here. the guy went from directing quality films to directing this mess, and has not directed anything since. he also wrote the film, but creative control was taken away from him here so it was not the film hed originally envisioned. so i give him a pass there. so, my final advice when it comes to gigli eat glass instead of watching this. it will be less painful.",negative

"one thing all 90s kids can agree on is that 1995 brought us one of the most kickbutt movies of the decade with the release of the movie adaptation of mortal kombat based of course on the popular arcade games of the same name. it was a huge hit, coming out at the perfect time to thrill audiences in a market that hadnt yet suffered martial arts and cgi overload. it boasted a fun storyline with mayhem and magic, had that amazing technosong, was populated with likable actors and was filled to burst with tons of awesome moments. who doesnt remember the hilarious intro to johnny cage, or the amazing puppetry on goro, or the sweet liu kang vs subzero match? with the game series evergrowing and expanding the mythology and the first film being such a pleasant surprise, we just knew that the inevitable sequel was gonna be bigger and better! theres no way it couldnt! ...right? then reality slapped us in the face with 1997s mortal kombat annihilation. a film that has gone on to join the ranks of batman robin and speed 2 as one of the most infamous sequels of not only the 90s, but arguably of all time. a failure that squanders all potential and destroys virtually all leftover goodwill from the first movie and instead replaces it with laughable writing, strangely overthetop performances, bizarrely dated effects even at the time and mind blowingly bad visual direction. picking up immediately after the original ends, the evil emperor shao kahn opens a portal from outworld and begins a process that will merge it with the earth in sixdays time, giving him total power. now, our earthheroes liu kang, sonya blade, jax and raiden must find a way to stop this devious scheme or else the earth will be lost forever. that may sound like a solid enough foundation to build a movie off of, but trust me... it doesnt work. the film is beyond fractured and frankly every single scene just lumps on more plotholes, unanswered questions and contrived pseudoexplanations in order to justify the proceedings... mainly so it can tenuously connect the constant onslaught of bad fight scenes that make up a majority of the screen time. director john r. leonetti seems in over his head with this film his directorial debut, taking over for original director paul ws anderson. leonetti and his army of screenwriters are never able to find any real sortof balance with tone, pace or style. scenes come and go are strange intervals, humor and drama never quite gel together, and subplots and characters are constantly jarringly introduced and dropped without consequence or reason. the visuals are also a marked step down from the original, with many shots being poorly thought out and unable to be cut together competently. theres also the issue of padding and choreography in many of the fights that lends to it all feeling very dull and forced. while the first films action does have a slight air of feeling fake in retrospect, it can be forgiven as it was one of the first truly hit martialartsbased films in the us. but this one just ramps up that problem, with so many unneeded flips and tricks that are thrown in to be cool and the bomb, that it just feels tacky and false. by the time you see the thirtieth random backflip, youll feel like doing some flipping yourself... flipping the channel to something else. the performances are among some of the hammiest ive seen in a major blockbuster. the only person who really emerges unscathed is the criminally underrated robin shou returning to his role of liu kang. hes great. everyone else? a caricature. lynn red williams as jax is a giant goofball who throws around unfunny oneliners like its nobodys business. reiner schne chews the scenery as kahns evil father. brian thompson constantly shouts his lines at random in an attempt to sound threatening as our lead villain. but of course musetta vander steals the show with her legendarily bad take on princess kitanas mother sindel, spouting some of the worst dialog ever written with the glee of a 12yearold on a sugarhigh. its outlandish watching her twirl and cackle and wave her arms about in her scenes... what did she think she was even doing? was she trying to channel ace ventura for her role? add to that... lowered production values gagworthy greenscreens and clearly rubber metal on the costumes and sets galore! shoddy costume design that looks like the actors are dressed in the walmart halloween costumes based on the movie rather than in real movie costumes wildly dated effects that looked bad even in 1997 were talking tron quality cgi at times... except this was made 15 years later ...and more and you have a recipe for disaster. that being said, i do have to make a somewhat startling admission... ...i kinda like this movie. oh, its bad. its really bad. but its so bad, that it springs right back up as one of those unintentional so bad, its kinda good camp classics. theres no way to hear lines of dialog like those you hear in this film youre alive! ...too bad you will die! without howling with laughter. theres no way to see the incompetent fight sequences where people are flipping through the air like heliumfilled balloons without chuckling and shaking your head. theres no way to see the awful, 80s quality digital creatures flying about without a bigold smirk coming across your face. so, if you like sobadtheyregood flicks... this is one for the ages! i give mortal kombat annihilation a 3 out of 10. its an awful sequel that effectively killed a franchise. but with some friends and maybe some booze, youll still have a grand time tearing it apart and laughing at its sheer ineptitude.",negative

"rave reviews, a 100 on rotten tomatoes, so many friends telling me i had to watch it. and... i guess im just not the right demographic for hacks. its a dramacomedy about an intergenerational relationship between two women in show business. at first they dont get along the older comedian is cantankerous, the young writer is disaffected. both use dark humor as a defense mechanism against a sexist, ageist industry that doesnt take them seriously. their shared struggle forms the foundation of a creative partnership that revitalizes their careers and leads to some drama and shenanigans, and i am so goshdarn bored with all of it. the story beats are too predictable for this to be an engaging drama. theres nothing here you havent already seen in other comingofage mentorprotege stories, and theres no demonstrated attempt to go deeper. where some people saw earned moments of heavy realness, i just saw facile dreariness. as a comedy, the show falls totally flat. i get that its really hard to write good jokes the early episodes talk about this, but damn, this was so unfunny. so trite and condescending. it just reeked of labased, careerminded tv writers who know the halfhour sitcom banter playbook forwards and backwards. if this were a 90minute feature film, it would be at least inoffensive and forgettable. stretched out over 5 hours, its dull and grating. way too much formula and too little inspiration. nothing surprised me, nothing made me laugh. hacks contains ideas that might have been compelling in the hands of more adventurous, bloodyminded writers. for me, its safe, fluffy, formulaic tv, and i dont need it. but if you connect with it and think its super smart and vital and ofthemoment, cool, more power to you. i wish i was having fun with you. obligatory jean smart praise shes better than the material shes given. i have no notes for jean smart. give her an emmy. whatever.",positive

"i remember watching this film as a semiretarded adolescent and not enjoying it due to the vague underlying themes that flew over my head at such a young age. however, last week, passing this movie in the blockbuster megadiscount bin, i decided to rewatch it and see if my opinion has changed. i tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, without losing some of the movies flair. i feel i have succeeded i must say, spending that 2.50 plus tax was the greatest decision of my pitiful and shameful life. in the 5 days i have had the vhs, i have watched this film at least 15 times, i unfortunately lost track after blacking out naked on my carpet on the 2nd day. this movie goes down in history as one of the 5 greatest drama sequels of all time, and if i had to put a rating on its comedy factor, i would give it 4 thumbs way up. i found myself laughing throughout the entire film, calling my friends and family to repeat jokes i had heard. the casting in this film is absolutely excellent, with shaq leading the performance like a frenchman in a yogurt factory. the story revolves around a genie named shaq, and a small italian boy named max. upon finding a magic stereo player, max discovers a small black genie living inside, and offers to give him a place to sleep and eat for a week. ironically, this is where the theme of pedophilia comes into play, with multiple scenes of max and shaq showering together and close up shots of them smiling. i hate to repeat myself, but as a child, i understood nothing about this subject. however, as a fleshy man, i see it in a new and blinding light. there are several moments throughout the play where the development of the characters and storyline drag, but the rest of the film certainly make up for it. the end is griping, and keeps me on the edge of my seat every time i watch it. at the same time, i cry when the credits roll and long to see shaqs black face one more time of course, i will rewind the movie at this point and watch it over again. on a final note, this movie is almost perfect in every aspect. this is the epitome of what a hollywood blockbuster should be. the casting is amazing, the special effects are mindblowingly realistic and stunning, the fully orchestrated soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and amplifies the experience. if i were to put a grade on this, i would have to give it a 910, losing a point because of the slight nudity im not the biggest fan, but i wont say no!. but, this is not a movie to be rated, it is a movie to be bought, watched, and enjoyed. do yourself a big favor and buy this movie, your taste buds will thank you.",negative
"reading the reviews, its possible to think that this is regarded as bad purely because of a vocal fanbase for the original. for instance, star wars the last jedi is a good film, but thanks to a small group of noisy fans a lot of the reviews online are negative. this is not the case here. i have never seenread the original, and i still found this to be a bad film. the cg effects look like something from a syfy original, the acting at times is reminiscent of neil breen, and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like crouching tiger, hidden dragon. if you enjoy bad films like i do, its worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is. 210",negative
"its been so long since clarksons last proper solo project. yes, i know hes become a game show presenter on itv but prior to then its been the best part of 2 decades since his last proper solo show. i loved speed, extreme machines, meet the neighbours and even motorworld from the mid 1990s, simply because of clarksons personality and views of the world. however, when i heard that jeremys amazon solo project was going to be a farming show i had really low expectations. how had a petrol head from doncaster suddenly become farmer? im pleased to say though, that clarksons farm is possibly one of the best programmes he has done. it is both hilarious and informative in equal measures at the same time. the humour feels completely natural, possibly down to the fact that it features real people. jeremy is being himself throughout and not having to hide behind the caricature of himself that has appeared in both grand tour and top gear over the last 15 years. here he is not trying to be funny, yet the situations he finds himself in are hilarious. the show basically shows us the challenge of the various aspects of farming, from tractoring, sheeping, opening a farm shop to harvesting. nothing goes as expected. clarkson is supported by his right hand man caleb, his advisors cheerful charlie and also his girlfriend. there are laugh out loud moments in each episode. aside from the laughter, viewers will actually learn a lot about farming and will also discover that jeremy is human after all when it comes to his sheep. not sure if they will be able to do another series, as hes covered just about everything here and i wouldnt want it to become overly scripted just to provide laughs and entertainment. highly recommenced.",positive

after reading the other views on the board about this film i felt compelled to put my thoughts in as they are actually a bit more uplifting to the film. i have been a fan of the horror genre for a long time and the films of the undead are of special value. i think that a lot of the comments that are made on here are by folks that dont respect the undead movies of romero etc. this film was actually a different change of pace. it offers a cross between dawn of the dead and island of dr. moreau. the special effects were grand to watch and the story kept the film going. it gave us new faces in which i hope to see again in the future. instead of going by what others say deciding that you are not going to see this film i say give it a shot its definitely entertaining!,negative
"the first 20 minutes of the movie are extremely boring and childish.after that there are a few scenes with loki which lead you to believe that the movie is going to pick up but it does not. the original score it self isnt very bad but it was badly written and protraed. jamie kennedys portrayal of the mask is ridicules,the character of the mask is not as crazy or wacky as in the first movie or in the t.v. series. the movie is quite funny and the animation is good the best parts of the movie are the ones with loki who is truly the only likable character in the movie.frankly i expected more from the mask2.",negative

"perhaps the best testament to the greatness of the room is its utter indescribability, its curiously strong resistance to mimetic, secondhand description. sure, you can easily sum up the banal, clich plot, or approximate the mindbogglingly amateurish acting and the hole filled, insanely convoluted, and just plain weird screenplay. youll make yourself laugh as you quote choice lines hi doggy! i feel like im sitting on an atom bomb thats about to explode! the world would be a better place if everyone loved each other. oh hi ! chocolate is the symbol of love. cheep cheep cheep! et al and mime wiseaus hilariously awkward motions and slurred cadences its not true, i did not hit her! i did noooot.. youll try in vain to convey the sheer weirdness of the incessant football playing, the hilarity of the jogging at the park, the brilliance of chris r., the beautiful bluescreened rooftop, the horrific sex scenes that never seem to end, the mantralike, gutwrenchingly saccharine pop songs that accompany said sex scenes, and the inescapable, minderasing voids of lisa and claudettes motherdaughter oneonones. however, frustratingly for the wouldbe promoter of the film, these sorts of descriptions do little in the way of actually capturing the genuine magic that occurs when one sees the room for the first time. after hearing about the film on npr, my interest was peaked. soon after, i discovered that there were several clips of the film available to view on youtube. after watching the rooftop conversation between johnny and mark, and an excerpt of the tuxedoclad football game, i was sold. living over 2000 miles from los angeles, i knew my only option was to purchase the dvd, which retails for about 11 on amazon. later that week, i found myself staring at wiseaus curiously droopy face and preparing, at long last, to watch the room. words fail to describe my experience i was immediately hooked. now, several months later, ive watched the film close to ten times, and i can say without hyperbole that it has become more fascinating and hilarious with each viewing. if youre reading this and youre on the fence about whether or not to go to a screening, or to spend the 1115 for the dvd, fear not you will regret nothing. in fact, youll begin to wonder how you lived for so long without seeing the room. well, what are you waiting for? do you understand life??!!",negative
"undoubtedly the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of watching in my life! this film, and i use the term loosely, was so awful that it is one of only a handful i have ever switched off in order to be bored instead as being bored is preferable to having your eyes gouged out by this dreadful piece of garbage. the story is non existent, even to the extent of parody, and the parody itself is done abysmaly with virtually no reference to the source material at all. in fact, this film is almost entirely made up of parody versions of clips from other films that were only taken from the trailers from said movies the vast majority of which arent disaster movies in the first place. how this is supposed to pass for a comedy film when it has no plot, virtually no parody and fewer jokes than the most dirgeful funeral i have attended is beyond me. perhaps that is the joke? if so, its not funny. whilst the rest of the genre made by some of the same production team such as date movie and superhero movie at least made parodical reference and jokes based upon films from the genre the relevant film was named after, disaster movie instead is just a description of what the end product turned out to be. we can but hope that this film puts nails in the coffin of the directors careers so they can go and be more productive in the film industry sweeping floors or emptying bins footage of which would be more entertaining than this drivel. mark my words no matter how bored you are, how cheap this becomes on disk or how free it may be on the internet do not waste your time watching it. you will only regret the loss of those precious minutes of your life, which could have been spent more satisfyingly and less painfully by watching paint dry whilst being beaten about the head with a mallet. forced watching of this film should be added to the bans under the geneva convention as torture. i for one would rather be waterboarded than see this film again. you have been warned!",negative

"the charm of this series is that it captures the period of time very well, with a story not just focusing on few characters but relationships of friends and family of the neighborhood through that time. the smart inclusions of details, pop culture references and intertwinning it with events of that time make the series immensely more relatable. simplicity of the shots, great acting by all, hauntingly melodious background scores all adds to it. it made quite an impression on me as i went along with the characters and the story with its funny moments, struggles, youthful romances, coming of age moments, i couldnt help but go down my own memory lane and fondly relive the moments that has gone by. as we all have gone through similar moments in our lives no matter which country one may be from. i guess thats why the series stays with you even when its finished.",positive
"i would love to view writerdirector martin brests original version of gigli, which was said to be a black comedy with very offbeat humor and no romantic subplot at all. i would also love to have seen how that film wouldve fared amongst critics rather than the one that was released to the public. during its release, i find the films extremely poor reception and disastrous box office performance unsurprising. the gossip about the relationship between ben affleck and jennifer lopez was overexposed, obsessive drivel and tabloids raced to the neverending finish line of publishing nonsensical articles about the couple and bedazzled them beyond recognition. this was one of the key things that led to ben afflecks negative public persona and made it irreparable until he adopted a directorial career in 2007. viewing gigli a decade later, when news of affleck and lopezs relationship has long past faded into obscurity, the film is nowhere near as bad as people have said. in fact, its a farcry from the worst film ive seen this year. id go as far as to call it somewhat enjoyable in the regard that its always amusing in the way the characters interact with one another and the way the actors handle the absurd material theyve been handed. however, in the long run, i prefer to view gigli as a product and discuss its impact on its actors along with how its time of release greatly affected its reception. but this will be explored later on. the film revolves around larry gigli pronounced jeelee, played by ben affleck, a secondrate mobster who is hired by his crime boss lenny venito to kidnap the mentallychallenged brother of a federal prosecutor to prevent the imprisonment of a new york mob boss. in addition, a woman by the name of ricki jennifer lopez, a dominant lesbian, is hired by giglis crime boss to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesnt screw this job up. it is a screenplay obligation that gigli and ricki eventually become attracted to one another, despite their differing sexual orientations. its no surprise why the film was panned, seeing as casting both affleck and lopez in a romantic comedy as their heavilydocumented marriage was approaching seemed to be nothing more than a tabloidsponsored film catering to the same people that inhabit the checkout lines of grocery stores with several of the magazines on the conveyor belt. however, affleck isnt the one giving the bad performance. his pseudotough guy appearance is intentional, something i hope people understood when the film was released and understand now. if anybodys performance should be criticized, its jennifer lopez, who gives a wooden, wholly unbelievable performance as an attractive lesbian, who still finds it amusing and fun to flirt with a heterosexual male just to revert to the im a lesbian line. her role is as contrived as they come, even with ten years of age. the most challenging role of the film easily belongs to justin bartha who later made himself a name in the hangover franchise, playing the mentallyhandicapped brother. his performance ranges from senseless exploitation to somewhat heartfelt and believable. it all depends on what writer brest feels like detailing at the specific time. once in a great while, well see his charming innocence come through. at other times, well see him sing a rendition of sir mix a lots baby got back and do a little wincing. the other thing to note is the films use of music, which seems largely out of place. consider the scene where gigli, ricki, and the prosecutors brother are eating lunch and bouncy pop music plays, somewhat indicating a sex scene or a scene of seduction. the music is entirely out of place and provides an odd shift in tone. scenes like this are rather frequent in gigli and the jarring tonal shift is hard not to notice when its something as quietly but noticeably abrupt as misplacedmusic. on to the legacy gigli has left. many people involved with the making of the film felt some kind of rough, turbulent backlash on their careers once the picture was released. it took poor affleck, as stated, years to rebound into a marketable, respectable name, and if it wasnt for stupendous directorial efforts such as gone baby gone, the town, and argo, his name would likely still inspire sneers and eyerolls. jennifer lopez never really got back on her acting feet after this film, and became somewhat of a faded pop singer who had little to offer. but the one person that seemed to be affected the most is director martin brest, who made films like meet joe black and midnight run long before this picture. gigli is the last film he ever made and has disbanded into something of a recluse since. he has given no interviews since its release, has not participated in any film projects, and has left his whereabouts to be nothing more than a thought in a persons mind. after the studio debacle with the films plot and creative differences, he has vanished into unknown obscurity, with no plans to direct or participate in any film again. it would definitely seem that people were too quick to label gigli as one of the worst films ever made. its definitely a rocky picture, very uneven, structured very peculiarly thanks to rewrites, and features performances that range from mediocre to above average. however, its an entertaining piece of work, if one can accept the challenge of ignoring its horribly low ratings and criticisms it has garnered over the years. this is the kind of film ill be judged for tolerating and, if thats the case, so be it. i got a handful of films at the top of my head that may make even the most hardenedgigli hater reconsider their opinion.",positive

"the electric state is nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is. but i guess thats just the way things are right now. mass appeal is no guarantee of excellence. the design of the movie appears to be based on a desire for mass appeal in a style which i can only describe as zeitgeisty. the problem with aiming for a kind of mass popularity is that you cannot afford to take a risk and try to be original. everything is on the nose. imagine a movie where they might use the track i fought the law by the clash and then predict in what context it might be used. they may as well use keep on running in a chase scene. that is the level we are talking about here. and the score is no less predictable. the electric state is filmmakingbynumbers writ large. a big budget buys technical expertise, big stars, excellent effects et al but cannot guarantee quality. the casting is an exercise in laziness. pratt sleepwalks as the rogue he always plays. mbb is the adultplayingteenwholooksanythingbutateen. need a jobsesque villain? who would you pick? and as for ge, i love the guy as an actor but he is the typecast actor of his age. i have never read the source material, but if the author is anything other than heartbroken by this cinematic adaptation he must be artistically and creatively bankrupt. i hope he was paid well. you cannot buy charm. you cannot manufacture nostalgia. you cannot force emotion. spielbergian the electric state is not. instead it is vacuous and cynical. that was unexpected, says one character. i expected it, replies another. and thats the problem. all of the money is on the screen and none is on the page. for all of the spectacle and visuals, the electric state is bland and boring. it is forgettable. the russo brothers have created magic with the electric state. they have managed to make 300 million and all of the expertise and craft that it can provide disappear. watch it if you must.",positive

"if youve seen a the movie, then you have a pretty good idea of what vampires suck is going to be like. it is going follow the plot and storyline of twilight all the while reinterpreting the scenes in its own way. the most jarring thing about the movie is the constant change of mood and tone within a scene which gives it no tension or buildup whatsoever. it lives and dies by the quality of its minute to minute jokes which are as previous installments quite hit and miss. though the movie is barely one and half hours long, it is fatiguing because of this. the movie starts off really well bella captures the nuances of the original bella and there is an extended act about vampire town which is quite charming. things devolve quickly though as slapstick and crudity is favored instead of satire and wit, and the movie fractures into banal shtick that is grating and stupid. however, this movie seems to possess a few more funny gems than compared to the others movies of the same fold hinting that perhaps that there is a glimmer of a chance that movies of this format can be good if done right. the biggest weakness of the movie is that it has to tear away from every funny environment it has created to chug along the storyline. if there is one word to describe the movie, it would be stupid. its a stupid stupid movie and perhaps enjoyable only if one is in the right frame of mind or willing to forgive the large amounts of feeble attempts at humor to find the good ones.",negative
"one of the best! i have watched countless anime including famous ones yk about it but damn frieren was one of the best shows i have watched. though the first few episode it feels mundane but thats the reason its a masterpiece! it doesnt feel like its rushed! the pacing, animations, storytelling, music, magic system, characters felt like they are not animated but feels like they are real people with their own backstories, and omygoshh the camera angles and fight choreographies are top tier! the series shows rich, expressive, and importance not only to the mc but also to the world building itself. i love how the show tackles that the mcs decision not only affects the sub characters and the supposed injured civilians like many shonens do, but it explores within the deep of how shehe changes the world around her, on how it affects mentally, academics, magic progression, culture, redemption arcs, personality, and different kind of weaknesses not just through power creep! one thing is sure frieren is truly a masterpiece! its not some fan service hent! blsht but rather a connection through romantic and platonic connections between characters and also the characters doesnt need to show an ounce of their skin cause seeing them in battle you will definitely get chills especially when they explain their moves such a banger! anyways, in summary i have heard about the opinions on how it is boring and dull but damn it really shows how immature some watchersreaders truly are that they cant recognize a masterpiece. but well at the end of the day its your time and energy so watch the things you want to. recommended 1110 a truly work of art.",positive

one piece was one of my favorite anime of all time until around episode 500. the various arcs with their stories and characters were highly enjoyable. the end of the enies lobby arc was the first time an anime actually made me cry and to this day whenever i go back to the scene that did that i still tear up. one piece was just that good back then. unfortunately the quality of the anime has dropped considerably from episode 500 onward. in the past when the anime was catching up usually toei animation produced a few filler episodes after they had finished a main arc. even though some of these fillers were weaker than the main story episodes it allowed them to continue with a good pacing while producing episodes on a mostly weekly base. however the amount of content that was covered with each episode got more and more stretched out the further we got past episode 500. i can easily provide numbers for this as well. the enies lobby arc had 56 chapters in the manga and was covered in 46 episodes. this means you had a bit more than 1 chapter per episode. the fishman island arc was the first one to have more anime episodes 58 than manga chapters 56. the dress rosa saga punk hazard and dressrosa had 172 episodes covering 148 manga chapters. the whole cake island arc had 95 episodes covering 78 chapters. this means we almost had 20 episodes within this arc with purely stretched out content and filler which dragged down the story as a whole because the build up to the fights and fights themselves got constantly stretched out. toei also used basically any trick they could to accomplish that. the most lazy and obvious attempts at this ive seen was for example an episode where we saw a scene three times in the same episode. first the actual scene happened and then there were two flashbacks showing the exact same thing again within the same episode. this just destroys any good element you may have within the story. to make one piece as good as it was the episode schedule would need to be changed so that they show sagas for about 6 months of the year while taking a break the other half of the year. toei wont do that though as one piece has been an important source of revenue for them for a pretty long time. and because of that the anime version of one piece is basically ruined. id easily recommend one piece until around fishman island 8910 rating. everything afterwards gets a 2 or 3 out of 10. i finally dropped the anime at episode 904 even though i hadnt really gotten enjoyment out of it for quite a while.,positive
"death of a unicorn is about a father and daughter whose relationship has been impacted by a schism, the death of the mother. for money, the dad has taken a job working for a strange family in the remote mountains. along the way there, the father strikes a unicorn in the woods. to put it out of its suffering, he beats it to death with a tire iron. then they stuff it in the back of the car and drive it to the mysterious home. there, they meet a family with mother, father, son, and servants...even security and medical staff...who all have no love for one another. the father tries to earn the high regard of this family by doing legal work for them, and that takes him farther from the daughter who he truly needs. this all comes to a head when the unicorns blood is revealed to have healing powers, and the loveless family decides to try and harness it and sell it to the highest bidders. the dad goes along with the plan, but jenna figures out that unicorns who are held in captivity will rise again and kill its captors. this is all because her mother once took them to some place where she saw a picture of a unicorn and she googled it and read all about how unicorns work. the unicorns parents show up and go on a rampage and start to unalive everyone, and the father will have to chose whether he will fight for his family or the other family he wants to work for. this sounds like it should be a good film, but the execution of this is really a mess. the film has unfunny jokes, terrible directing, bad acting, boring set and costume design, even the unicorns are bad cgi, paul rudd looks like he wants to be anywhere else, and jenna ortega does her best with this one but there isnt much for her to work with. worst of all, this movie wastes noho hank from barry, which in and of itself deserves to have the film docked several stars. ill say that the story was clear and concise throughout, it never goes off the spine and there is a resemblance of a good screenplay in this film. but it feels like maybe they put the budget to get the actors and shortchanged the rest and it shows. this kind of film really needed more of a tim burtonesq feel to it because its so over the top and instead its like a bad slasher movie that tries to be artistic and witty and it just falls flat. ill be honest, the original leprechuan franchise is better than this waste of a good idea. i think this film would be fine to watch late at night maybe 2 am no a streaming service, but i wouldnt pay to see it in theaters.",negative

"novocaine is a new action film directed by dan berk and robert olsen, directors of villains and body. nate jack quaid suffers from the autosomal recessive disorder cipa, which, among other things, prevents him from feeling physical pain. when sherry amber midthunder, the girl hes dating, is kidnapped during a bank robbery, he must do everything he can to save her. his inability to feel physical pain can actually help him during this mission. because the main character cant feel pain, the film risks lacking real tension. however, the protagonist still faces the risk of being seriously injured or losing something like a finger during his struggle with criminals. additionally, others he cares about are at risk, and these characters can feel pain. fortunately, they manage to balance the film with comedic moments and entertaining action scenes. these action sequences also lean toward the brutal and bloody side. however, the film does run a bit too long and might have too many extra characters. if it had been trimmed down to about an hour and a half, the film could have had a better pace and been more enjoyable. jack quaid delivers well as someone who, despite not feeling pain, prefers to play it safe to avoid accidentally or unknowingly getting hurt. nevertheless, he has to face this danger to save his girlfriend. amber midthunder plays her role well as his girlfriend, who tries to keep him safe but occasionally pushes the limits. together, they come across convincingly as a couple. ray nicholson also plays a fitting role as one of the criminals in the film.",positive

"technodystopia vibes, fear of technology, and a world thats literally gone to the bots. these and other scifi elements make the electric state an unoriginal but irresistibly engaging story. it strikes a fine balance between thoughtprovoking and entertaining, with a dash of futuristic charm that made me smile more than a few times thanks to how well it emulated 90sstyle scifi storytelling. between chris pratt as staff sgt. john d. keats not his best work btw and millie bobby brown as michelle grin neither hers, the movie tells a gripping tale of distrust and deception. the narrative takes off when michelle learns that her brother christopher played well by woody norman isnt dead after all. part of his consciousness, bizarrely transferred into a robot, propels her on a quest to uncover the truth. along the way, she ends up gathering a misfit duo keats and herman and experiences a whirlwind of quirky moments, of the artificial kind, in her determined search to find out what really happened to her kidbrother christopher whos still alive, somewhere out there. a rich roster of voiceovers brings various eccentric characters to life in this movie. standouts include alan tudyk as cosmo, woody harrelson as mr. peanut, ke huy quan as pc and dr. amherst, anthony mackie as herman, and jason alexander as ted and wingman. human performances from stanley tucci as ethan skate and giancarlo esposito as colonel bradbury the butcher further enrich this wacky sciencefiction escapade packed with misadventure, mayhem, and misunderstanding. the most meaningful message i found in the electric state where theres sentience, theres often a simmering strain of rebellion. this theme elevates the movie beyond its veneer of actioncommercialism, making it deeply relevant. the movie cleverly balances philosophical depth with unapologetic entertainment value, showcasing robots with rights and revisiting a donetodeath scifi trope namely, robots rising up against their perceived enslavement. aialarms aside, the electric states subtext draws compelling parallels to human beings themselves protesting on behalf of our waning purpose in a world thats growing digitally biased toward machines. immigration mismanagement undertones, vrheadsets neurocasters for mechacontrol purposes, overt fears surrounding sentient ais alreadyproven ability to communicate among its own im looking at you, google and the importance of human connections in a digital world are just some of the key takeaways from this regaling story. mr. peanuts calltoaction we were built to think, but now they dont want us to. we were built to work, but never for ourselves makes my case for me. it drives home the fascinating direction in which this seemingly ordinary movie chose to convey a profound and resonantly human truth. noteworthy moments from colman domingo as wolfe voiceover, joe russo as skeevy bot voiceover, brian cox as pop fly voiceover, and hank azaria as perplexo voiceover.",negative

"i was eight years old when this film came out in 1999 and back then i absolutely loved it. just recently, after remembering how much i loved it then, i thought it would be fun to watch it again. that was a mistake, because everything about this movie is purely idiotic. what was i thinking? the acting is almost indescribable and the plot is a train wreck. my advice to those out there is that this movie should only be watched by children at the absolute most. young children and hope that the parents dont have to watch it with them. kids will love the goofy moments while the parents will cringe. so it depends on your perspective... if youve made it to junior high school, then youll hate this movie.",negative
"tvf returned with another heartfelt memoir, encircling a traditional middleclass family. although there isnt much for prevalent structuring alternately they used short stories to make an imitation of all the little incidents that occur on a regular basis. truth be told, i never felt happier while watching a web series before. a joyful smile was persistent on my face throughout the whole duration. belonging to the akin middleclass background, cant help but notice how each trait had so much resemblance with our everyday lives. a grounded yet cogent appeal that not only leaves a mark but also helps you to establish an acquaintance with the onscreen family. that too with enough subtlety. comprised of four main characters they all correspond to every other household in our country. coupled with some outstanding performances, sufficient technical competence, and an ethereal soundscore abounding contributions from all these critical aspects do make it even better. regardless of petty flaws i truly appreciate what i finally got out of this commixture! where simplicity easily prevails in every plausible direction. highly recommended! streaming exclusively on sonyliv",positive

"the fine men and women of the police academy get seconded to moscow to help the police there deal with the threat of the moscow mafia. namely one konstantine konali who has invented a video game that is sweeping the nation. he plans a sequel that will include a piece of software that will him access to any computer that comes in contact with the game. can the officers get enough evidence before he succeeds? meanwhile lassard gets lost and moves in with a russian family. i always feel that when even the support characters start to back out of a film series then youre onto a loser. surely the fact that even steve guttenberg felt hed had enough by part 4 should have told the makers and the audience that enough was enough. the plot is oh arse, whats the point!!? imagine all the characters being allowed to get into all sorts of stupid and unlikely situations all in the name of dumb jokes and youll have an idea of what this is about. the plot of bringing down the russian mob is only evident at the start and end the rest of it is just one silly pratfall after another. some of it is amusing ive always found lassards innocent wanderings to be pretty funny and the only smile i had was where he wnet off with a russian family! none of the cast have anything approaching ambition or drive. they seem happy to be sitting in their cartoon characters for 7 movies! gaynes is as dopey as ever but i like that. graf is dead now and its sad to think this is his legacy. i have seen him in other films and hes ok when hes not just shouting and firing comedy guns. winslow needs to get a new act does anyone find the human sound effect funny anymore? easterbrook is blonde with large breasts and thats all the film needs her to do. schlatter makes a weak lead man and is real poor. but wait my god but who are these support actors? is that claire forlani? why yes it is, well i suppose she was still at the bottom of her career ladder. oh no tell me that isnt ron perlman, but it was and he just seems content to be in an american movie no matter how bad it is. worse still is the fact that christopher lee is in this at all i know he is having a great spell at the moment but is this how low he sunk at one point? overall this has almost no smiles in it never mind laughs of any form. even die hard fans of the series and idiots who laugh when they see the colour red will struggle with this.",positive

"right now, this is my nominee for best new series. its certainly cleverly written and gives us characters so selfabsorbed and eager to please...welleager to please their buttered side of the toast, i.e., daddy. the assortment of personalities assembled at any given time is deliciously, wickedly triumphant. dressed to the nines and living in surroundings just short of european royalty, the damage that each character is doing to themselves in an effort to harm others is a kind of guilty pleasure not usually offered on any major network. we usually see these types held up in admiration. not so here. you wouldnt want to spend a second of time with any of these folks...other than to be a fly on the wall and see what degrading thing theyre up to next. i was disappointed that one of the major character was so emasculated at the end of season 1, although perhaps by the end of season 2 he will have regrouped to wreck havoc on his family yet again. the poise of sarah snooks siobhan as she sinks a dagger into the heart of anyone nearby is particularly admirable. and kieran culkins roman is the family clown that shows how pratfalls masks a very insecure, desperate character that probably everyone needs to look out for, is deserving of his being singled out for an acting award. hiam abbass as a kind of step mother lady macbeth holds her own in this nest of vipers, and anyone who is smart enough to cast j. smith cameron in anything, anytime, anywhere should get our thanks. ditto for giving us jeannie berlin. but its brian cox as pater familias in extremis who provides the glue that holds all of this craziness together that wins my praise. alternately compelling, brilliant and truly terrifying, he proves we never get to see him enough in our entertainment. long may this family live and demonstrate, it aint so great to accumulate riches.",negative

"anyone who has previously seen a film of acclaimed french director jeanpierre jeunet should not be at all surprised with the utterly resplendent, outstanding imagination that fills every moment of this one. what is surprising nonetheless is the absolute breadth and depth of that imagination, and its wit, charm, and warmth. every last trace of amlie overflows with it, to the point that to run down a list of all the ways in which the pictures dazzles is essentially to break down how pictures get made. jeunets bewitching shot composition, and his keen orchestration of every scene bruno delbonnels enchanting, wonderfully dynamic cinematography, practically a living character unto itself herv schneids impeccable editing fantastic, colorful production design, art direction, and costume design lovely hair and makeup work fabulously whimsical characters, dialogue, and scene writing to build a quirky, offbeat narrative with equally whimsical humor supremely nuanced performances to realize those ever so unique characters seamless, fanciful, seamless effects both practical and special yann tiersens splendidly inviting, rich original music flawless sound design... am i missing anything? is there any way in which this film is less than perfect? and still, for all the cheeky, smart, fantastical idiosyncrasies that the feature can boast, it is but a complement to its unyielding soulfulness. glaringly few are those movies that are unfailingly characterized by so much positivity, that can truly be said to be altogether lifeaffirming. there is drama here, but it is surely just about as light as as drama can get, with the result that the end product is exquisitely entertaining, satisfying, and rewarding, as precious few titles can claim to be. its no wonder why amlie has garnered such acclaim and so many accolades, for it is without a doubt the best movie jeunet has made in an already incredible career defined by exceptional visual design one of the best movies to ever come out of france one of the best movies of the twentyfirst century and possibly one of the best movies made since the advent of the medium. what other motion picture has ever burst with so much unremitting joie de vivre? how many other motion pictures have ever been so worthy? i dont know how to lavish still more praise on this without betraying spoilers. im almost ashamed to admit that when this first saw release, i overlooked it in my ignorance of what it was about. i dont think id have been able to appreciate it as much twentytwo years ago as i do now, though, and regardless, the wait was absolutely worth it. no matter who you are, amlie is a mustsee modern classic, and thats all there is to it.",positive
"when i first read the news that there is an animated fulllength feature film being developed called the emoji movie, i took my hand and forcefully applied it to my forehead. this movie was absolutely uncalled for, yes, we do live in a generation where everyone has a phone or computer and sends each other instant messages, sometimes adding emoticons to reflect their state, but that doesnt justify the need for it. what made sense to pour out 50 million into making this picture? and how come it ended up making over 250 million at the box office? its beyond comprehension.... the emoji movie centers on a city called textopolis, which is basically in everyones smartphone, and the residents of textopolis are various emojis that have a daily job of making faces and emotions whenever the phone user selects one of them in a text message. the main character is gene meh, a...meh emoji that doesnt like to stick to the norm of one single emotion and is targeted for deletion due to his multiexpressions. he bands up with other malfunctioned emojis in order to escape from the software agents that are hunting them and find the code to fix gene. the adventure takes them through various apps like just dance, candy crush or instagram. the film is literally a marketing gimmick for phone apps. the fact that sir patrick stewart appears in the film as the poop emoji had me worried for a bit, but fortunately his appearance is short and minor. the animations arent halfbad, but thats about the only good part of the movie. all the jokes fall flat, there was not a single moment where i actually laughed. judging by the targeted audience of teens and preteens, i expected to have more triumph over toys and merchandise, but it didnt really pick up. the emoji movie is a film that shouldnt have been made and instead should have invested the budget into something else.",negative
"theres little to be said about this movie without dissecting it piece by piece and shot by shot, and thereby betraying plot points the sting is all but perfect, down to every last detail. this goes for david wards screenplay characters, dialogue, scene writing, and narrative, all dynamic and engrossing, and throwing a couple surprises at the audience. this goes for george roy hills direction, and robert surtees cinematography lending to exquisite arrangement of every shot and scene, and vibrant imagery from start to finish. the casting is extraordinary, with notable and very recognizable names and faces robert redford and paul newman, of course, but also eileen brennan, robert shaw, robert earl jones, charles durning, ray walston, dana elcar, and charles dierkop, among still others. everyone turns in outstanding, nuanced performances that are inescapably enchanting and kudos as well to the stunt performers for fine contributions. sound design, effects, art direction, production design in every way, the sting is a feast for the eyes and ears, wonderfully entertaining all the way through. set design and decoration, hair and makeup, costume design, lighting, music the rarely since the end of the great depression have the 1930s felt so distinctly real and tangible. and the picture fills every last corner of this setting with moments of sharp action, zestful humor, and tension and minor suspense, all realized with the superb acting of every player among the assembled actors. somehow ive only just watched this for the first time. without knowing much of anything about it, and without especially trying, i think i ended up avoiding the sting because, out of youthful folly, for me it fell into a broad swath of wellregarded features starring wellknown actors that was too evenkeeled and unremarkable to really grab my attention. well, the jokes on me i have a much better and broader appreciation for films than i used to, and this solid fun, plain and simple. true, sometimes flourishes of stylization in the editing seem a tad too overt, or the narrative threads tie off a bit too neatly in some ways recalling more recent blockbusters involving complex, grandiose schemes. yet these qualities are all intentional, and factored into the pictures cheeky levity and charm. honestly, i rather had mixed expectations when i began watching, but they were very quickly dispelled. short of going on a far more verbose ramble, take it from someone who was more than a little skeptical about this before i actually sat for it the sting is a greatly enjoyable film thats tremendously well made in every respect, and it more than holds up 50 years later. dont make the same mistake i did for too long if you have the opportunity to watch this, you must.",positive

"the dabangg franchise has never been one that made me think wow! this series is amazing. i enjoyed the first one as there was some competence visible and effort put into it. the second one lost all the strengths of its predecessor and barely had anything charming about it. however, what salman khan has done to the third installment is absolutely atrocious. dabangg 3 reunites us with chulbul pandey as we see him go up against balli singh, an enemy from the past that destroyed his first love. this story isnt anything special. weve seen countless films in the past that have used this exact same storyline and now its at point where it has become old and overused but since salman khan knows people will turn up to his film no matter what its about, it was a smart move from him to write the most generic revenge story. speaking about the writing, this screenplay is one of the worst of the year. everything is so bland. so many of the jokes fall flat which make it excruciatingly difficult to sit through the films 2 hour 30 minute runtime. i feel khan should just stick to acting because writing is not his cup of tea. from the trailer alone i could tell how bad this film was going to be but i had a bit of hope that at least the action would be entertaining to watch. apart from the final battle, every other action scene had nothing exciting about it. on top of that the action wasnt even shot well. there were a few times where you couldnt tell what was happening due to the poor camerawork and direction. prabhudeva, what went wrong?! lets not forget the unbearable editing. there is so much slow motion used which make the scenes go on forever and visual effects that are completely unnecessary. the background score was obnoxious throughout and the overabundance of songs dragged the film further. i feel the choice of having an origin story had a lot of potential. it would have been a great way to add further depth to chulbuls character and help us learn more about the villain but sadly none of this is explored in much detail. salman khan does an earnest job as chulbul pandey even though, a couple of times, he was a bit too over the top. sudeep also does a good job despite his severely underwritten role. he brings a good amount of intensity to his character but we learn nothing from his character. hes one of the most basic antagonists you could come up with. the female roles were also played well but had very little to do. they just served as plot points and nothing beyond that. at this point this franchise should end. all the humour, charm and wit that was gained in the first one has been fully lost in dabangg 3. this is one of the most boring films of the year and an absolute pain to finish. i wish abhinav kashyap would come back to help give this series the boost it needs.",negative

"seeing glitter with an open mind, despite its notoriously awful reputation, it is not quite as horrendous to be down there with the worst films of all time, but the problems glitter has are plentiful and are significant enough to consider it a very bad film still. the good news is that mariah carey does sound absolutely incredible, always have loved her voice with its beautiful tone, emotional connection and uniquely wide range. also terrence howard is quite good and steals scenes. however, careys enviable skills as a singer does not translate in her skills as an actress, it was really strange that an artist with such a huge vocal range five octaves! is the complete antithesis in her very onenote and often expressionless acting here, which is devoid of any joy, surprise, sincerity or emotion. the ability to connect emotionally with her songs also doesnt translate in the acting, she looks stiff and bored throughout here. unfortunately, the songs here do nothing for her vocal talents either. she sings them very well indeed, but there are far more memorable and emotionally powerful songs from her out there that also display her unique vocal gifts much more. theyre not awful, just bland. the rest of the acting is also poor, with max beesley being equally lousy and not sounding sure what accent to pull off, while with the characters careys is shallow, onedimensional and very difficult to relate to which is a huge dividend considering the type of story it is and the rest are annoying caricatures, a couple even irrelevant to the story. even for a film set in the 80s, glitter does much less than glitter and looks firmly stuck in the 80s. it looks gaudy and too much of the camera work is too gimmicky and amateurish. the structurally waferthin script, with clumsy attempts at being hip, embarrassingly unfunny humour and poignant moments that come over as emotionally manipulative, sounds even older than that and like an awkwardly written soapopera rejected at first draft and should have stayed there. glitter has very little story, its very thin and aimless, and padded by the bland and uninspiredly choreographed songs shot like a series of out of date music videos and subplots that come out of nowhere and go very little further than that i.e. the reappearance of the cat or the reunion with her mother. it starts tedious and loses even more drive as it plods on, and throughout like careys performance theres no joy, no emotion and no substance. the direction is decidedly inept. overall, not that horrendous but it is no wonder that carey herself regrets being involved in this. 210 bethany cox",negative

"my daughter took me for my 67th birthday,ive never played the game or even seen anyone play it. but i have to say i had a good time. made me laugh a number of times. and so many easter eggs in reference to many movies were scattered throughout the movie,that especially if youre old enough to catch them all. and im pretty sure i missed a few. and watching jason momoa make fun of himself and really play the self deprecation was hilarious. a man with a heart and a sense of humor. takes someone not full of themselves to play a character like that. pretty much forgot about it the next day,but a few days later started thinking about again. and every time i do,a couple times a day. i get a big smile on my face. so i must say,well done guys. its basically a new twist on jumunji. we and im all for it and hopefully well get to see number two.",negative
"ignoring how much better the first film is, and judging this on its own merits, it is still atrocious. ill get the few good aspects out of the way the direction and cinematography are decent. john mctiernan makes good use of the camera, camera movement, overhead shots, etc. the infamous night vision scene is so strange and awful that it comes back around to being awesome truly bizarre stuff. theres one good song in the movie and some decent stuntwork... thats about it. theres too much bad to mention the actors are all awful. whoever cast chris klein in the lead should be shot by a firing squad. he is particularly horrendous here, acting like hes a badass for no good reason. ll kool j deserves a mention here, too he stinks. what little social commentary there is, is hamfisted and given only maybe 5 minutes of screentime. the story serves very little impact and is only there to justify the action scenes. during the action scenes is also where the direction falls apart, you have no idea where characters are in relation to one another, and often it is just a flurry of bodies flying thru the air one after another, like some sort of bizarre kungfu flick. except this is technically a sports movie, so there desperately needs to be some coherence to the action so you can know the stakes and who is winning. but instead each rollerball scene is just a mess. theres a bad 90s metal soundtrack that probably sounded dated upon release. paul heyman of ecw fame makes a pointless cameo. its 90 minutes, but feels like 190. i spent extra time doing the dishes in order to avoid this movie, thats how bad it is. this is hard to watch for all the wrong reasons. utterly irredeemable.",negative
"are you a fan of the game? im sorry to say that theres not much chance youll be a fan of the movie. it disappoints with everything from bad acting to lousy dialogue. but there are a few bright spots, though they might be hard to find. ive tried to focus on the good parts. jeremy irons seem to like playing bad mage and he does it with some style. marlon wayans character is not too good though, he lost a lot of the respect he earned with me from the excellent requiem for a dream. mr. saving the world himself is unstable, there are times that he reminds me of what i thought the hero in dd would look and act like, but in some scenes he seems more like a boy scout than a hero. the visual part of the movie is ok. there are some good animating and some less good and moody settings. a few times i actually felt that the scenes matched quite a lot with my impression of the game. the people in charge of the costumes also need a pat on the shoulder, especially irons good guy costume was nice. for the action freaks there might be some good moments...for me there was one fighting scene that was worth watching over again, but not more than that either. to sum things up a bit its bad, sort of really bad, but with a few glimpses of potential for the observant ones. in other words this is not a movie you need to see. im sure there are other movies that will please you a lot more. rating 310 yvind holen",negative

"the electric state captivates with its engaging narrative and thoughtprovoking themes, exploring a techsaturated dystopian america. the films strength lies in its welldeveloped characters, particularly the moving portrayal of the brothersister relationship, which forms the emotional core of the story. visually, its a masterpiece the vfx are stunning, creating immersive and richly detailed environments that truly bring the world to life. while the musical score is adequate, it doesnt leave a lasting impression. my primary critique is the rushed and somewhat predictable ending, which felt like a missed opportunity for a more impactful conclusion. despite this, i wholeheartedly recommend the electric state. the films compelling characters, strong themes, and breathtaking visuals make it a worthwhile watch for fans of dystopian narratives and characterdriven stories, especially those who appreciate themes of familial love and the complex relationship between humanity and technology.",negative

"i can only shake my head at some of the fawning filmschool comments here. yes, sellers performances are brilliant, youll laugh out loud at his dr. strangelove, and the rest of the cast is excellent. yes, it was an especially daring satire for its time, making light of a subject that was deadly serious in 1964. and yes, youll enjoy the kubrickian touches and details the contemplative camera, the cold lighting, the political sarcasm, the signature head bent, eyes up expression from george c. scott which we later saw in clockwork orange, full metal jacket et al and the final scene set to intentionally light and inappropriate music, a precursor to the evocative use of blue danube waltz in 2001. for all these reasons, see dr. strangelove. but the whole is less than the sum of its excellent parts. its simply not a great movie. the set pieces in the war room and keenan wynnes office drone on and on towards modest punchlines, the b52 scenes are interesting mostly to electricians, the attack on the military base resolves awkwardly, and the movies climax is clumsy at best and yes, i get the intent of the final cut away from the warroom. the movie as a whole hangs together poorly. although not a great film, its an important film, especially for its time. see it, but temper your expectations.",positive

"as many fans know, jim carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. his comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. but anytime before 1998 i think i can safely say that not many people saw carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasnt truly in the comedy genre. i definitely didnt see it coming. and to be honest, i wasnt sure if i would really enjoy it. but in the end, i did, not only because of how well carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up. the plot is about truman burbank jim carrey who is viewed live 24 hours a day, uncensored, as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting. the thing is, truman burbank is the only one who doesnt know this. everything else around is all a setup. and when i mean everything,...everything...is a setup. even the sun is fake! nothing is real. all the people burbank knows are all actors. people who go through the same routine every day. and thats partially what makes this film so great. every piece of the set that truman burbank lives in is so believable. along with this is christof, acted by ed harris. christof is the creator of trumans world and he essentially plays god. everything that truman burbank is as a person, was created under the supervision of christof. the whole story itself, written by andrew niccol, brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture. who should have control over whose life. well i think that answer is obvious. jim carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but its not because he wants the movie to be a comedy. carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny. and along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance. sure carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama. thats a question a lot of people wanted to see if carrey could pull off and he did it well. adding to the emotion is composer philip glass score. yes, it did evoke the right emotions and i dont think it needed a theme either for this particular story. usually i do, but it didnt seem necessary here. unfortunately for me, i prefer to see jim carrey in his comedic skin. i didnt mind the different role that he took on here but it didnt feel like i was watching the movie i wanted to see. and ill admit, i put too much thought into believing jim carrey wouldve made the film more comedy than drama, so basically i disappointed myself. so on that note, it could be disappointing to fans of carrey for his comedic films as well. as the first drama film that comic gut buster jim carrey stars in, it is not that bad as some would expect it to be. carrey can deliver a performance like real human but for the hardcore fans, it may upset.",positive
"yet another modern spoof by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer, the starving games has as its main focus of parody the hunger games film. alongside it, multiple referencesspoofs of other hit films like the avengers or expendables, or popular culture in general. friedberg and seltzer have for very long tried to copy the parody style of david zucker, with varying degrees of success scary movie was very good though i believe that was more due to the other screenwriters involved, like the wayans brothers, as was wrongfully accused to a lesser degree though that was more due to nielsen than their writing, but the rest of their works tend to range from regular to terrible in fact, their more aimless, messy spoofs epic movie, disaster movie are amongst the worst films ive ever seen. starving games falls in the second category, with some genuinely funny moments like the aforementioned avengers and expendables spoofs but with a lot of bad ones including, for example, the rather tasteless sex scene. friedbergseltzer try so much to cram as many hip references as possible, that by the end the final product is an unfunny, idioticlooking mess. the fact no actor here managed to give a good comedic vibe, which could save some scenes something leslie nielsen was very good at, makes this worse than it could have been the actors dont even seem to try at all, and no one has any charisma especially the main actress. unfortunately, while this is a slightly better attempt, it doesnt give me hope for their future career. the fact their comedies seem to keep having a degree of audience success means they will keep with this formula. guess i will just have to learn to stop bothering with their films.",negative

"depending on when you watched this first or will watch it, it will determine how much impact this will have. obviously if youve watched it back in the day, sentiment will kick in too. and while i wouldnt go as far as to say this hasnt aged well at all, there are some indicators that the impact today for some new viewers will not be the same as back then. having said that, the movie still holds up, as we get some missfits thrown in together and mixed up. all with different backgrounds, all with different issues and problems. all rebelling in their own way though. against the teacher of course. but the authority figure here stands for more and the class struggle, the growing up struggle, the maturing struggle, the being in school struggle all stand for something. so while you may not feel the biggest association with any of the characters, if you really dig into the movie, there is much to find here",positive

"greetings again from the darkness. has there ever been a bad pixar movie? nope. and as many really good movies they have created, there are now two truly great ones toy story and toy story 3. the first one released 15 years ago transformed the way animation is made and set the standard for kids movies that parents can also enjoy. this third installment takes animated story telling to the next level. of course all the great voices are back woody tom hanks, buzz tim allen, jessie joan cusack, mr. and mrs. potato head don rickles, estelle harris, rex wallace shawn, hamm john ratzenberger and sarge r lee ermey. imagine assembling that cast and then adding two fabulous new characters lotsa huggin bear ned beatty, ken michael keaton expanding jodi bensons barbi to a key role, and revamping slinkydog with blake clark taking over for his deceased friend, the fabulous jim varney. this is major star power and an overabundance of talent! then again, we have all seen stellar casts fall flat without a worthy script. fear not as pixar legend john lasseter exec producer here has passed the reins again to director lee unkrich toy story 2, finding nemo, monsters, inc.. this story is brilliant and engaging. i challenge anyone from age 5 to 95 to avoid being drawn in to the themes of separation, friendship, loyalty, and power. there are some laugh outloud moments along with the usual wise cracks from buzz and potato head. this time we are also treated to some darker moments with lotsa, a powerhungry stuffed bear, and his band of misfits that include a giant baby doll and chuckles, the creepiest clown this side of poltergeist, and especially the frighteningfunny monkey working security. some pixar touches include the voice of andy is provided by the grown up voice actor who did andy in the first, a couple of glimpses of the evil kid sid first toy story who has grown up to be a garbage man same shirt and the reuse of randy newmans classic song youve got a friend in me. too many other little moments to mention, but this is pure film genius and should not be missed.",negative

"when it comes to sequels, theres always a worry that they wont capture the same magic as the first one. but moana 2 knocks it out of the park! it doesnt just follow in the originals footsteps it takes things to the next level. with stunning visuals and a story that hits you right in the feels, this film is truly a win and deserves all the praise its getting. from the start, moana 2 pulls you into a colorful, lively world that feels alive. the animators have pushed cgis limits, making everything look super realistic. the ocean is as beautiful and authentic as ever, and the landscapes are packed with detail, celebrating the stunning polynesian islands. you can appreciate the effort put into showing each wave, piece of grass, and beam of sunlight. what shines are the cultural touches throughout the film. the traditional polynesian designs are not just pretty they also show great respect for the culture they represent. the filmmakers have put a lot of heart into creating a world that feels authentic and magical. the music in moana 2 is incredible. linmanuel miranda is back, bringing his unique mix of catchy tunes and heartfelt lyrics. the songs are so moving that youll find yourself humming them long after the movie ends. while the original moana had some fantastic tracks, this sequel somehow ups the ante with new and timeless songs. each song fits perfectly into the story, boosting the emotional weight of key scenes. whether its an empowering anthem or a more reflective ballad, the soundtrack delivers. its not just background noise it plays a vital role in telling the story and revealing the characters feelings in ways that straight dialogue cant match. moana 2 takes the characters on an even deeper adventure without giving too much away. the story is rich with themes like selfdiscovery, strength, and the power of community. what makes it unique is how it blends these universal ideas with personal stakes for the characters. the writing is sharp, heartfelt, and surprisingly funny at times. the humor feels natural and fits seamlessly into the situations. meanwhile, the emotional moments hit home, making for a few tearjerker scenes. its a story that speaks to everyone, with different layers of meaning that can resonate based on where you are in your life. one of the standout features of moana 2 is the character growth. moana still symbolizes bravery and determination, but the sequel lets her develop in real and relatable ways. the supporting characters are just as compelling, returning favorites and new faces adding variety to the story. the relationships between the characters are a big highlight. they explore connections genuinely, emphasizing how vital understanding and connection are. watching these relationships grow throughout the film adds depth to the whole narrative. at heart, moana 2 is a tribute to polynesian culture and the adventure spirit. the filmmakers worked closely with cultural advisors to keep everything authentic, producing a fun and educational movie. its a celebration of heritage that feels respectful and inspiring. moana 2 is a rare treasure that surpasses expectations on every level. its visually breathtaking, emotionally impactful, and rich in culturea perfect mix of heart and art. whether youre a big fan of the original or new to moanas story, this sequel is a mustsee that will leave you feeling inspired and uplifted.",positive

"this review is mainly meant for anyone who watched fullmetal alchemist and is either considering brotherhood, has watched a few episodes and not liked it, or has read one of the negative reviews and was put off. when i first heard about fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, i was skeptical. seeing as the original fullmetal alchemist is the first anime i have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that i have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. what could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as fullmetal alchemist? with hesitation and doubt in my heart i started watching the series... and instantly hated it. i wont lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didnt live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. i cried, i screamed, i broke things, i didnt do any of the above because im exaggerating and not actually crazy, but i was still quite upset. the criticisms bubbled up inside me until i was frustratingly glaring at the tv appalled at such changes as alphonses voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic in those days, we really believed... lines from al. with each passing episode the insults to fullmetal alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in brotherhood, and i was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. but then, my eyes began to open. right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates i started to think that this story might actually be good. as the episodes began to fly i realized that it wasnt good, it was great. after finishing the series i knew without a doubt in my mind that what i had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. the story of brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly dont compare. after having my eyes opened i was forced to drop the rating that i gave to the original to an 8 simply because now i knew how much lost potential it had. if you enjoyed the story of fullmetal alchemist, stick with brotherhood and i guarantee you that you will not regret it. not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music in my opinion at least, some disagree, characters, and overall feel is far better. therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series dont give up on brotherhood after only a few episodes like i was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldnt miss out.",positive

"martin scorsese at his undisciplined worst. the wolf of wall street is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. i get it, i get it the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the wall street world depicted in it. but excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. the first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and i was sure i was experiencing a film that would go down as one of scorseses best. but as it went on and on, and leonardo dicaprios performance became more and more histrionic, and the film made the same point over and over, i had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie youre really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike. the wolf of wall street is of course critic proof. anyone who doesnt like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter, as if its an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they dont think its any good. whatever. its an overblown mess, stupid when its trying to be funny the quaalude scene, for example and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of americas greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself. grade c",positive
"this movie is bad, and i am pretty sure this was intentional. it clearly makes fun of itself and adds a lot of dumb jokes and weird scenes for no purpose. to impress the teenagers also a bunch of bare breasts got added. probably director john gulager was so distracted by this human meat show, that he completely forgot to insert a plot of any kind. but does this really matter at this point? i dont think so. switch your brain off, lean back, stare at the naked bodies, ignore the nonsense lines and get wasted while the movie progresses. the remake was bad already and anybody who expected a sequel to this would do the franchise any good must be out of his mind... or distracted by... you know the drill!",negative

"because it slightly shifts from the original format, it is automatically said to be rubbish. jeepers is my favourite movie franchise. it takes us to a new expanded story. the two main characters are very talented and act brilliantly all the way through. they have the fantastic acting abilities, adding a few witty one liners. it takes a interesting turn with a creepy fair. of which, i wish i could go to. its better than the 3rd effort that was released. its atmospheric, creepy and plenty of jump scares. i enjoyed the building of the main characters and it was done so you are interested in their welfare in the movie. i loved every minute.",negative

"in all honesty, i have struggled to find an animated film that is as amazing as this one. up has all of the qualities you could hope for in an animated film high quality graphics, convincing voice actors, suitability for kids and adults alike, and a compelling storyline. you feel yourself experiencing emotions with the characters as they go through challenging, fun and frightening experiences. the way that this film makes you feel empathy is incredible! my dad, who is renowned for hating animated films, was convinced to watch this with me, my mum and my younger sister, and afterwards he actually admitted to being very impressed and saying that he would happily watch it again in the future! so, even if animation isnt your usual style, i recommend that you take a chance and experience the wonder that is up.",positive
"though some of the first season was cringeworthy. this second season is about as masterful as anyone could hope for. it starts a bit slow, the first episode, but soon finds its legs and impresses again and again, captivating me as if i werent quite seasoned. it feels like a review of every thought ive ever had at a vacation resort, many of which id long forgotten. on that score alone its a delight, but not to worry, it goes way beyond that to flirt with operalike heights of drama and beauty something quite appropriate given its setting in sicily. given the excellence of the acting and the seeming effortlessness of the story i would have to say mike white, this series creator, is some sort of unsung genius. the guy seems unaware of boundaries coupled with one of the sharpest eyes for detail ive ever seen.",positive

"not only is steve carell playing it too hard, but he simply isnt listening to anyone else, and that seems to be part of his character choice. without effectively listening to the other actorscharacters, he is robbing some of the painfully comic humanity of the character. that is what made ricky gervais interpretation brilliant is that the actorcharacter actively listened and then made the wrong decisions, and knew it in his subtext those painfully brilliant glances at the camera! but he just couldnt help himself and kept drowning, which made it even more comically uncomfortable to witness... that said, perhaps carell will relax into the role after a couple of episodes. the rest of the cast has a truly natural docucomic ease to their performances, which leads me to believe that the director andor writers and powers that be knows what needs to happen. perhaps the ghost of gervais is just too intimidating right now?",positive

"i have just watched this film for the first time, can confirm it is worse than what i had heard it was. now as a rule i dont always take note of reviews of films, even if they are bad, as certain films can be bad still quite enjoyable, even if the acting plot are okay. unfortunately, this is not only all the above, but also pretty tiresome downright tedious as well. the main unknown to me anyway leading threesome are all dreadful from this showing awful actors as well. justin whalin is just laughable one of the worst heroes in a long while. probably since val kilmers appalling performance in the saint. zoe mclellan is pretty enough which probably explains away her deficiencies amongst other reviewers but is still dreadful. the worse though is marlon wayons, whose performance is not only awful completely unfunny, but also of a racist nature. the rest of the actors are also bad, but at least the likes of jeremy irons, bruce payne thora birch, know they are only slumming it, are at least decent actors if the material is there. the plot is also weird ridiculous, with no explanation of what is going on, the upsetting thing was that the poor dragons couldnt have snacked on the lot of them, which would of at least made it a happy ending, for us the dragons anyway. if you want to see a well acted well made fantasy film watch lord of the rings instead.",positive

"this movie is a disgrace. that statement has been used to describe many movies, but in the case of this absurd rollerball remake, it extends to many planes of meaning. for one, this movie destroys the originals plot, pacing, and anything at all that set it apart and made it a classic. this disgusting remake disgraces its original more than the avengers, more than godzilla, and yes, even more than batman robin. beyond the initial corruption of the classic 1975 rollerball, this remake is a disgrace to jean reno. seriously, this man needs to do more research before choosing a movie. we know he can act well, we just know he can do it. look at leon the professional. this is yet another crapball to tarnish his record. the worst disgrace this movie is guilty of, however, is its absolute ineptitude. this film fails in its basic charge as a motion picture. this movie is unforgiving. if its not hurting your brain with idiotic lesbian jokes, or attempting to titilate you with frontal nude shots, its forcing you to observe brainless, pointless extreme!! sports, like deathluging or an action favorite, driving like an idiot. and dont forget the thirtyminute scene filmed with a green filter lens, to simulate nightvision. i have a camcorder, too, guys, and turning that little green thing on in the dark does not make your movie clever, edgy, interesting, or even watchable. id hoped i could forget this terrible film, but ive taking it upon myself to dredge up the awful memories of it once again, to warn others. do not see this movie. it is not so bad its funny, its so bad its painful. and if youve ever see the original rollerball, just ignore this awful remake. hopefully now i can sleep at night, hoping this message has saved at least a few poor souls.",negative
"being a fantasylover that absolutely must go out to see every fantasy flick that comes out can be pretty excruciating at times. before dwar, i hadnt seen an honesttogod fantasy flick since at worlds end im not counting stardust, which was just a romantic comedy masquerading as a fantasy flick. so by the time dwar came out, i was starving for a decent fantasy film. thats not to say i had high hopes for dwar. i wasnt expecting star wars or lord of the rings. hell, i wasnt even expecting pirates or narnia. i was just expecting to be entertained. even a flick as frowned upon as eragon managed to entertain me. but let me tell you, dwar makes me long for movies as good as eragon. yeah, its that bad. as with most fantasy films, dwar comes to the plate with two strikes against it clichd plot and bad acting. this is something that any fantasy aficionado is quite used to, however, and these things alone arent enough to completely ruin a flick of this genre. as long as it manages to be aesthetically absorbing and maintain a level of excitement, it can succeed. where dwar completely flubs is in its pacing. the film starts off extremely slow, almost grinding to a complete stop several times in the first 4550 minutes bare in mind this flick is only 90 minutes long. by the time the hour mark rolled around and i had barely seen anything even remotely resembling a thrill, i actually pulled out my cellphone, turned it on, and looked to see what time it was so i could guess how much longer my suffering would endure. the second half of the film is where the action starts piling on, but after all the dull exposition and rising action of the first half, its hard to get excited about the action in the second half. and there really isnt all that much solid action. pretty much everything youll see in the film is what you already saw during the trailers. giant snakes masquerading as dragons running rampant through the cities, giant armies of canonfodder troops taking up formations weve already seen in countless films of this nature since the mid90s. in all its a brainless, mindnumbingly dull adventure flick, a great deal of it ive already seen too many times. unless you have small children, you might want to skip this one entirely.",negative

"i went to scary movie with no expectations i knew it would most likely suck and thought i knew that i still disappointed. when you go to a comedy movie you expect to get at least a few laughs, let me tell you you will but not because the movie is good. through the whole movie me and the person i went with where saying are you fcking kidding me, omg and youve got to be kidding me. it was so unreal to be in a movie that sucks that much. half way in the movie you want to leave but you wont because there will be a funny part? let me tell you there are no funny parts! you will see what feels like a high school project which wont even be enough to receive a c. and that movie did cost 20 million dollars. the first scary movie was pretty funny from there on it went down the road with this movie as the lowest point you can get.",negative
directly to mr. om raut and mr. manoj muntashir if youre reading this. i mean what was the need to do this and if needed ..you need to creat your own story..not on the name of ramayan. just think that if you people made it properly than people respected you so so much...on the name of the disclaimer..you did whatever you wanted to. totally unacceptable coming to the dialogues total chhapri 3rd class dialogues by mr. manoj muntashir. honestly you people should be banned on making any movie on a religious topic you people created a joke on the name of ramayan. boycott guys boycott. money wasted.,negative
"when i first heard that there was going to be another dumb and dumber movie, i was really excited, but then i heard that jim carrey and jeff danials would not be returning, so i figured, this ones gonna suck. so sitting down to watch it i was expecting the worse, but i was delightfully surprised when i found out this movie is actually good. pretty much all the jokes are funny and there really isnt any sort of lull in the film, like the first one had. the story is simple and the characters are great. all the performances are really great, especially eric christian olsen and derek richardson both a very good and pull off a young harry and lloyd very well, i found richardson to get annoying after a while, but olsen was dead on the entire movie, he is exactly how jim carrey used to be before he left wacky comedies to do more dramasthis kid could be carreys son, and could probably pull off young versions of ace ventura and the mask. i predict youll be seeing more of mr. olsen in the future. the other actors in the film were also very good, but the one that stood out most was eugine levy, man, is this guy hillarious or what, just seeing him makes me want to laugh, and hes particularly effective as the principal in the film. so basically this isnt the greatest film ever made, but its also not the worst. it does what it sets out to do, which is to provide a few laughs for an hour and a half. if you loved the first then you should for sure check this one out 710 stars",negative

movie would have been better if they have considered more fact from ramayana. lanka shown in thia movie was full black...how come palace made of gold is black. most of the movie part is black. no shola used to more this more effective. they replaced pushpak viman with a bat. ravana is taking massage from snakes... this all made movie a bad one. also many i.portant part of ramanaya was not shown such as fight when hanuman was crossing sea or tail of him enlarged before lanka fire etc. role of laxman was really not considered well. prabhas and kriti acting is good. even of saif but direction of movie and dialogs are not ipto the mark.,negative

"just about everything in this brilliant satire of cold war politics is perfect. kubrick created his first template masterpiece with this hilarious comedy that sees military bureaucracy as a comedy of errors and a hotline conversation between the president of the us and the premier of the ussr as a snippy fit between quasilovers. you have everything you could ever want here great dialogue, fantastic acting, flawless directing, cool sets, and timely political farce that could still ring true today in this age of bush america, institutionalized fear, and the war on terror. everyone deservedly raves about peter sellers in his multiple roles as mandrake, the president, and dr. strangelove, but i dare you to find a funnier performance than that of george c. scott as the slapdash overzealous general buck turgidson, especially when he falls over backwards in the war room and gets up and continues his speech without missing a beat. also of note is sterling hayden as jack d. ripper. his riffs on the purity of essence, bodily fluids, and communist infiltration through fluoridation are laughoutloud funny. with characters like colonel bat guano, and slim pickens major kong, great scenes naturally flow forth, and kubricks one take on pure comedy is simply genius. he was wise never to touch the genre again fully although a clockwork orange will always be a comedy in my book, as he made the perfect example of the form here.",negative
"first id like to thank the guys at mst3k who made watching this movie possible...really, thanks, couldnt have done it without you. plot summary a family is driving and driving...and driving...and driving... through the countryside and beleive it or not gets lost. they wind up at a spooky lodge. there they meet torgo, the guy who takes care of the place while the master is away. eventually the master shows up. he has a fetching cape with the hands of fate registered trademark of manos... logo printed on it. he worships manos, an evil deity of primal darkness, who dwells in the depth of the universe and the black chasms of night and is essentially very very bad. so after a lot of talking an less of doing, the movie ends...? manos the hand of fate is a horror movie through and through. the plot, the acting, the music...horror. it is quite remarkable though how the crew yes, they had a crew managed to put in so much sexuality in a movie of the 60s...hmm. i have seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but none of them came even close to the horror that is manos th hands of fate. was it fate or just the hands of a very untalented director that lead to the making and release of this movie? perhaps we shall never now... in conclusion did i mention how horrifying this movie is? this is the absolute worst movie ever!!! i can only imagine they spent the entire budget on renting the cabin,so there was no money left for acting lessons, or directing lessons for that matter... if you are one of those people who gets a kick out of sharpening pencils, suffer from schizophrenia, personality disorder or have had half of your brain removed, i highly recommend you watch manos the hands of fate. if not, watch the mst3k version...its a blast.",negative

"finding nemo, pixars best yet. stunning visuals, a great star cast to voice it, an original and heartwarming story, and amazing humour. what more could you want!? every character plays an important part in finding nemo, as opposed to movies that focus on the protagonists. the star cast that voiced this film were purely perfect, e.g. ellen degeneres for dory! that was absolutely brilliant! she steals the show! finding nemo, has what some pixardisney films dont have. and that is morals. they arent forced into you, theyre very subtle, but they are strong enough to keep you thinking and to make an impact on you which i think is fabulous. the moral is loving your kids is great...overloving them isnt. a moral like this makes sense for the present and im sure many young people would understand and relate. the film also defines universal. many universal films you see have a couple of drops of crude humour, its harmless, as its too little for young kids to understand, but its still there. finding nemo is completely clean, squeaky clean in fact. whether youre 1 or 100, finding nemo is sure to please. this one is definitely a must watch. watch it! i command you!",positive
"if you even think about going to see the horror masterpiece feardotcom, i urge you to take off your shoes, stay at home and stare at the wall. you will be much more entertained. trust me. the directors and producers forgot about several things. first being a decent script. the second, having quality actors. third, estabishing mood lighting for a scary movie instead of having everything take place in a dark room or two. part of the movie takes place via digital cameras. it worked for the blair witch project. it kinda worked for halloween 8. it did not work here. william malone, the director, favored cgi over story telling. too many of the scares were laughable, too many of the scenes pointless.the only saving grace for my 5.50 was the trailer for ghost ship before the movie. the lead actress, natascha mcelhone,looks like a cross between crystal gayle and meryl streep, with the acting ablitiy of tawny kitaen. shes just that bad. stephen dorff emotes like a wood board. only one expression for fear, confusion, and insanity. please, i urge you to say home and stare at the wall. save your money. you will thank me in the end.",negative
"i dont know what it is something about the way he carries himself, i think, or his mannerisms, or subconsciously, maybe even an association with some of the characters hes portrayed but in the past i often found myself put off by jesse eisenberg. its not that i specifically avoided his movies, but nor were they ever on my shortlist to watch. somehow i completely missed his directorial debut, for example. with costar kieran culkin receiving major recognition for his performance in this, eisenbergs second outing as writer and director, i felt i would be terribly remiss not to give it a look. now that i have, its mightily affirmed to me that i should be paying far more attention to a fellow who, being relatively young, has been achieving so much. for all that a real pain does well my overall opinion of it is still perhaps a little mixed, but where it succeeds, it does so with flying colors, and i can appreciate why its been received so well. and all told, i cant argue with that reception. eisenbergs direction is focused and mindful, giving himself, culkin, and their fellow cast members plentiful opportunity to explore each moment and let it breathe and resonate even while the picture often maintains a rather steady pace. to much the same point, its plainly evident that eisenberg and cinematographer michal dymak aimed to exhibit the beauty, honor, and complexity of a country that, broadly, tends to be cloaked in our perception in the shrouds of the war, oppression, and gloom in its living history even as the sights to greet us are indeed very easy on the eyes, every passing shot feels very purposeful, not least as the characters tour takes them to places of especial profundity. and im kind of stunned by the sobriety and introspection of what eisenberg wrote, for i never in a million years would have expected this screenplay from the same guy who starred in zombieland and american ultra, and who played lex luthor in zack snyders dceu. we have, at once, two cousins struggling with their personal issues and anxieties, and also trying to work through the difficulties of their relationship a journey taken in respect of their late grandmother, their heritage, and the innate generational trauma and an exploration and demystification of poland, and of the horrors that were perpetrated there only short decades ago. and while there is plenty of humor throughout these pages to provide levity and balance, and to keep the proceedings relatively light, my heart aches with how earnest the picture is at its core. with that said, i think the broad scope of the writing, and eisenbergs stringently faithful execution, is what troubles a real pain to some degree. there are, at times, major clashes between the manic energy and blunt, outspoken nature of benji davids deeply reserved and bottled up composure, a reflection of how he tries to manage his own apprehensions and mental health and the sincere intentions of the trek to europe, and the places it goes. these clashes are more severe than what i believe was suitably intended as a key source of mirth in this comedydrama, and in fact the issue is significant enough that the first impression the feature makes is kind of rough. early scenes are intended to be awkward, but i altogether flinched for how uncomfortable the hopping tone was, and i harbored doubts even as i admired various elements. however much praise the sum total earns, it isnt perfect. but, oh, it does earn substantial praise. somewhere around the halfway mark those tonal matters begin to fold into each other, ultimately gelling into a cohesive and meaningful whole. as the narrative progresses eisenberg ably weaves all the varied flavors and ideas together not coincidentally, though humor remains, the more heartfelt drama rises to the fore and takes precedence. so even as eisenberg as an actor, and supporting costars like jennifer grey !, will sharpe, and kurt egyiawan, provide firm, reliable anchors from the outset, and even as culkin all but roars to vivid life from the getgo with a vibrant performance inhabiting mercurial, somewhat volatile benji theres no questioning that he has earned what award nominations he has garnered there comes a distinct point around which the flick finds its center. an understated but tense, emotionally dense dinner scene potently brings into clarity the heart of what ails david, and benji, and their relationship, and makes benjis prior outbursts and zest snap into focus if they hadnt before. in that same scene, eisenberg gives a performance so soulful that he nearly outshines culkin, and also everything else hes done. from that scene onward the overarching temperament changes, leading into a sequence visiting a historical site so stark, truthful, and solemn that eisenberg arguably outdoes one of the most revered films of the 90s, and later into a small, quiet scene which, outwardly presenting with wry sensibilities, belies a subtle grim comment on how some peoples meet with barriers even in how they try to grieve for their dead. yes, a real pain is a comedydrama, but at precise, carefully calculated junctures, its astonishingly heavy. across all moods, the music dominated by the works of chopin is a surprisingly adept complement at times perfectly meshing, and at times bearing its own wry implementation, while always shrewdly evoking class, legacy, history, and memory. by jove, the score is such an intelligently devised component of this title that it nearly matches eisenbergs script in its sagacity, and wherever the credit lies for that stroke of genius, i can only extend my compliments. all this is to say nothing of how well made the piece is in general, claiming all the best of modern production values. the strengths here are undeniable, however, and for however much love we may give to culkin for his impressive performance, or to others involved, at length i am above all struck, again, by how it is the star of adventureland who has conjured such a complicated, thoughtful, impactful picture. clearly ive been mistaken in ever discounting jesse eisenberg, and if works of this caliber is what the man is capable of, then i absolutely look forward to seeing more from him in the future. between the sometimes emotionally distressing places this feature goes, and the uncomfortable tonal issues, i can understand how this wont readily appeal to everyone. for my part, though, i sat to watch with no foreknowledge and mixed expectations, and leave exceptionally pleased with how very good the result is. a real pain is a real treasure, and i can only give it my very high and hearty recommendation.",positive
"this movie is one of the best, if not the best, 80s film there is. the fact is, every teen character in this movie can be related to someone we knew in highschool. as a child of the 80s, i can honestly say that this is a representative crosssection of every high school in north america. the geek, the jock, the outcast, the rich prettygirl snob, and the future criminal. they all exist, to some degree or another, in the classrooms of every high school on the continent. what makes this film rise above the rest is the character development. every character in this film is threedimensional. they all change, in one way or another, by the end of the film. whether or not things remain the way they are long after this film ends is unknown, and that adds to the rama. the most important scene in this film is when the characters, as a group, all open up to oneanother and describe the hell that their daily school routines are in a personal fashion. nobody likes the role they must inevitably portray in the highschool scene, but the fact is, it is often inescapable. this film gives the viewer some insight into how the other people around them might have felt during that particular time in their lives. each of the main characters in this film shines, but judd nelson john bender and emilio estevez andrew clark rise above the rest. simply put, these two actors each put their heart and soul into their respective characters, and it shows. at the end of the film, the viewer is left to make their own conclusions as to how things will carry forth. and im sure that most people will do that. this is one movie that left me feeling both happy and sad for each of the characters, and it isnt easy to make me care about a film in that way. even if you arent a fan of the 80s genre, this isnt one you would want to miss. my rating 1010",positive
"take the oscar winning coda and mix it with back to the future and thats basically it. coda had the same theme of the protagonist wanting to be a musician even though her family was deaf. also the theme that the person who could hear was relied upon too much by the rest of the family. of course back to the future was the son making sure his parents got together. the show just borrowed way too much from those movies for my taste. the movie also too neatly wrapped up the challenges the characters face. also i didnt think the lead actor was very good especially in the emotional scenes. hyunwook choi was very good. he was was charming, funny and believable in his role.",positive

"i took my sister to see this movie on presidents day when we both had the day off. i was expecting a funny movie in scary movie fashion. what i got was this piece of crap that was a complete waste of an hour and a half and my 6.50. whats the problem? oh where to begin...first of all, the plot is stupid. its simple enough, i guess, but theres so many random things that just dont make sense the random weird flashbacks during the kill bill sequence, for one. i dont know if its just that the parody genre is being stretched so thin that there isnt anything left anymore, or if this movie was just bad writing. the acting isnt terrible, though some is cringe worthy. i think they tried so hard for going over the top that the jokes turn out disgusting, offensive, gratuitous, and just plain not funny. nearly every sequence with jinxers, the jones family cat, are horrid and disgusting. nearly 98 of the jokes i had to tell my sister i would explain to her when she was older. and to complete it all, i was in a theater full of teenage boys, and not one of them laughed once, which goes to show how much the film falls on its face. the only time the audience gave a halfhearted chuckle was during the mr. and mrs. smith sequence. so save yourself the time and money. skip this absolute zero.",negative

"after being blown away by fearless, i set out to see more of peter weirs work. along the way i came across the truman show. after watching the film, i have nothing but praise for this film. the truman show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. beautifully scripted by andrew niccol and flawlessly directed by weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. here carrey plays truman burbank, the star of the worlds most popular reality show. the catch is he doesnt know that. truman believes he lives in seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. this realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again i find weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. having loved his performances in liar liar and the mask, i was looking forward to seeing jim carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in partsin a subtle way in alternative to hysterical is very sympathetic and moving. ed harris is great as christoff and laura linney is outstanding as meryl. overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 1010 bethany cox",positive

"i really like this show. i am fan of the office and obviously the way this show is shot and the pacing are very similar. but what is also similar is the depth of the characters. they sneak it up on you. initially they are all just entertaining and silly, but as the episodes unwind they slowly and tactfully turn the characters into real people that you bond with. there is so much negativity in the world. the news media and the internet would have you believe everyone is horrible. however one of lifes truths, that i strongly believe, is that the majority of people are inherently good. for me, i prefer shows that show people as being good and caring. i think because we have been so desensitized and made defensive by the news media and other medias that it is so much easier to process niceness when it is presented in a funny way which is what this show does. finally i have to say i love the mrs howard character. she is just so realistic and reminds me of so many women i have met and seen in action in my life. women who stoically keep things working and moving in this country. what a lovely and admirable character that plays homage to so many real heroes.",negative

thats why its strange that the texas chainsaw massacre return has been the worst movie in the franchise so far. it is possible to say that nothing is saved in this repetitive and bland plot. kim henkel, screenwriter of the first film, returns as director and also takes over the script in this film that is basically a retelling of the 1974 classic a group of young people have a minor car accident while leaving graduation festivities. when looking for help in the surroundings, which means going through a stretch of forest to get in touch with a houseestablishment, the young people come across the family of degenerates and the bloodbath enters leatherfaces agenda... in this beginning, the prom isnt even shown, as jennys friend heather fights with her boyfriend barry and the four young men hit the road. the characters are so ridiculous that henkel doesnt even try to write interesting dialogue for them in the first ten minutes of the film, when we should at least get to know the young people better. what presents itself is the traditional conversation about sex, and nothing more. soon, there is an unlikely car accident on a country road, and the inevitable separation of the group jenny, barry, and heather go for help while sean stays with the driver of the other car, who is injured. the trio meets darla, a tow truck attendant, who calls her brother vilmer to pick up the cars. vilmer is matthew mccaughey, another who is in an awkward start to his career this is his fourth film. at the same time, jenny returns in search of her boyfriend while heather and barry find a home in the middle of the forest. theres leatherface robert jacks, horrible!, with a mask that doesnt even convince. leatherface kills barry with a sledgehammer to the head identical to one of the young men in the original film, traps heather in a freezer ditto and then hangs her on a meat hook identical to the first movie!!!!!. the difference is that, in the original, the girl hanging from the hook showed pain and fear, while here the terrible actress doesnt even scream convincingly, and we dont even see blood dripping from the wound she has a hook stuck in her back!!!!. that leaves jenny, who spends the other 50 minutes running around, running from the killers, being arrested, running away again, being arrested, fighting with them, getting beaten up, being tortured, mistreated, and so on. some of these chases are good, like the one on the roof, others not so good until we get to the messy end. any normal person would be horrified, traumatized by half of what jenny goes through in the movie, but she keeps her sanity, not screaming, not even showing fear and horror, as marilyn burns did so well in the original movie. since the beginning of the socalled tension and horror that the director wanted to rescue from the original, we see that the trip will be long and not pleasant. the weak script gives us the worst characters in the franchise, a kind of stereotypes from the original movie and with incredibly stupid dialogue. some chase scenes are pretty silly, and most of them are done by vilmer, like the one where he chases sean or jenny in the car. and the quotes from the first film dont stop there at onepoint jenny is chased by leatherface through the woods, with the chainsaw buzzing incessantly, until she finds shelter in the towing service, where she thinks darla is a friend, but she, in fact, she is part of the psychopath family exactly what happens in the first movie, when sally is helped by cook dreyton sawyer!!!!. as we all know, its never good to trust texas people, especially in a chainsaw massacre movie. jenny is then tied up as with marilyn burns in the original, bagged ditto and taken back to the house ditto, placed on the dinner table as in the first movie for another screaming and torture session.... its impossible not to mention that on the way to the house, inside darlas car, jenny screams, cries and kicks, then the villain threatens her stop screaming immediately! for the imprisoned girl not only stops crying and complaining at the same moment, but also speaks, totally dismayed okay, but im not able to breathe, with the greatest calm in the world, as if i were a crying child who just got a moms ear poke! and she doesnt scream anymore, even when darla is approached by a police officer and a scream from jenny could betray that the woman was a kidnapping psychopath. despite several passages identical to the original, this fourth chapter doesnt even come close to the first. in addition to not having a minimum of violence and horror no one is butchered for dinner, for example, nor is there any mention of cannibalism what it seems is that everyone is crazy, and thats it, the film becomes ridiculous and comical in several moments, especially in the bad characterization of leatherface, who spends most of the film dressed as a woman with dress and makeup, screaming and even taking orders from jenny who, at one point, yells at him to sit down and shut up. mouth, and thats exactly what old leatherface does!!!. in fact, leatherface doesnt do anything else in the movie. he appears as a transvestite, visibly overweight and dressed as a woman, and is totally overshadowed by vilmer, who suddenly becomes the films biggest villain. then, just when we think it cant get any worse, jenny is tied to a chair at the family dinner table and a man in a limousine appears out of nowhere, dressed like an executive, with a refined english accent. and he goes into the psychopaths house as if he were a member of the family. jenny thinks he went to save her, but actually hes crazy too rothman then starts grabbing her and licking her, and his chest is slashed with scars and piercings!!!! the mysterious character approaches vilmer and says you know why you are here.... i want these people to go through the truest horror. did you understand? well, neither do i! nobody bothers to explain, either, what kind of family relationship those completely different misfits have do leatherface, vilmer and darla have any kinship, for example? and what happened to the originals family, if the return would be a direct continuation of the first movie? the only members of the original family present are leatherface and grandpa of course!. if renee zellweger never comes across as a helpless, lifethreatening young girl, the worst interpretation by far is mccaughey, who plays a hysterical type, always screaming and wanting to be badass and scary, when in fact is the most caricatured and unfunny villain in recent times. when he wants to look scary, he widens his eyes and starts screaming. but the worst is when he has a tantrum and starts mutilating himself with a knife just like hitchhiker does in the original movie. lacking in rhythm, the return of the texas chainsaw massacre is weak, tasteless and presents us with a psychopath without any impact, armed with his chainsaw, but unable to act because of producers concerned with censorship. all in all, this fourth part is a total mess, it tries to bring new elements to leatherfaces story and make some references to the 74 classic, but it only let the viewer more confused. the script doesnt even try to give a greater sense of clarity. everything ends up in a disastrous ending, full of holes and meaningless theories. every 10 minutes, the story introduces new elements, without any fuss, which leaves everything messy and poorly done. presenting us with a mob bow and a leatherface drag queen, this movie is completely unnecessary, comical, offensive and bad, but really bad. no wonder the franchise hit rock bottom after this movie and only reinvented itself after the remake, in 2003.",positive
"im a 57 yo female and ive been binging on this show. yes, its written for the 1835 male demographic, but im 43 episodes into it and look forward to the next. some have talked about the bad plots,the onedimensional characters, the yelling over top of each other. yes, yes, and yes. if you notice, however, there are usually 3 plots per episode carried by groups of two or three main players. each plot unfolds within the series of skits that make up each show. in this regard, its much like 30 rock with absurd plots, unbelievable characters, etc. i love 30 rock, too. the characters are like asteroids. each a simple little bit of inorganic rock that sometime in the past crashed into each other and stuck. whenever one spirals in, so do they all. and it happens every show we just never know what that is going to look like. as for the screaming im from back east pittsburgh, not philly where people talkholler over each other, at high volume, with amazing frequency. it transports me back to the land of thick skin. the beauty of this in this show whether intentional or not the yelling is a character itself. when it enters a scene, anything or anyone not engaged in the shouting ceases to exist. i find that hilarious, especially when the yelling stops and the characters seem to not notice it even happened. only the poor bystanders are aware. very stoogelike. so thats my two cents. sophomoric, blue, controversial issues, lacking in social graces, scatological. whatever. it hits its demographic and some unlikely outliers.",positive

"i am perhaps lucky that i grew up, and live near to where the show is based, glasgow. so i have no issues with the accent and pretty much that is the way many around this area speak. my only gripe is the overuse of swear words, to try and get a cheap laugh. not necessary guys the show is funny enough without that. after a slowish start, as with most sitcoms, as we get to know the characters, the show is on a steep incline in terms of laughs and quality. first 6 seasons are very good and as good a comedy as you get anywhere. the 2 main actors had a bit of falling out, i believe, which is why there is a big gap between season 6 and 7. they patched up their differences, had huge sell out tours in 2014 and brought back the show in 2016. there are some decent episodes in season 7, 8 and 9 but generally the quality took a nose dive, like many sitcoms that outstayed their welcome last episode is very poignant, which leaves the viewers to decide for themselves the ending, some memorable characters, naveed, and his wife, isa, tam and winston",negative

"clark kentsuperman christopher reeve is still having saving people lives in metropolis and sometimes the whole world, when he is flying. in the time, when the nuclear war might still happen between the american and the russians. the world is still never safe and people still lives in fear. but when a young boy named jeremy damian mclawhorn thinks that superman could disarmed the whole entire nuclear war by writing an personal letter to the daily planet. superman sees in the boys point of the letter, he decides to talk to the united nations for peace on earth. but things are slowly changing, when supermans number one enemy lux luthor two time oscarwinnergene hackman is having plans to kill superman once and for all with the help of luthors nephew jon cryer by using a piece of supermans hair by creating an superclone named nuclear man mark pillow. a superclone so powerful that is radiation charged. now superman has to find ways to destroy nuclear man before he gets lux luthor. directed by sidney j. furie the entity, iron eagle made an amusing, intentionally campy if extremely cheap sequel to superman films. this fourth movie was produced sadly by the king of lowbudget pictures of the 1980s cannon films. which cannon films were going down, when superman 4 was produced after they were involved with box office disappointments like lifeforce, invaders from mars remake and over the top. originally warner bros give cannon films 40 million to produced the fourth picture but they only used 17 million to make it. they used the rest of the 23 million by producing other movies sadly. special visual effects of this one truly did hurter the movie, theres only a very few fx sequences were good but not many to make it memorable like the first two films. also superman 4 feels choppy at times, not everything is logical in the story. while many scenes hit the cutting room floor before it was release. if the producers or the director kept some of the scenes that make some sense in the story. the premise could have been much more. but on the plus side, what i feel make superman 4 watchable is the good performances from the cast. reeve is terrific as always in the title role. hackman is a joy seeing him playing the villain. margot kidder as lois lane is also fun as well. i did like the new characters in the film played by cryer as luthors nephew and mariel hemingway as lucy warfield. which hemingway plays the daughter of a billionaire tycoon who bought the daily planet and she also finds herself attractive to clark character. pillow isnt bad in his only film as the villain but when he speaks, it is unintentionally funny most of the time. dvd version from the recent deluxe edition. dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen 2.351 transfer and an decent dolby 2.0 surround sound. dvd includes an fascinating commentary by mark rosenthal star trek 6the undiscovered country, the beverly hillbilles, stephen kings sometimes they come back. which the coscreenwriter of the film talks about how cannon treated the production badly, why the special effects looks so lame comparing to the previous films, character developments and the scenes were deleted from the picture. dvd also includes deleted scenes from the workprint which some are fascinating but they dont including some of the deleted footage what rosenthal mention in the commentary and the original theatrical trailer. superman 4the quest for peace was a major box office flop in the summer of 1987. but it somehow find life on video and its great entertainment for the kids. reeve came up with the premise of this feature along with rosenthal and coscreenwriter lawerence konner the jewel of the nile, tim burtons planet of the apes, mercury rising. which reeve wasnt sure if he wanted to do another superman film if cannon films will help produced one of reeves personal project called street smart. which that film was notable for oscarnominated supporting performance by oscarwinnermorgan freeman as the violent pimp. but reeve at the time, he felt he could make it up for the superman 3. for his career at that time, it seems to make it much worse. but i think for me anyway, i felt superman 4 was improvement storywise from the third film. also nothing could top the villain luthor as well, no matter what the screenwriter could come up with. die hard fans of the comicbooks or the films might be more forgiving with this one. joeduntoncamera scope jdc scope. 12 out of .",negative
"well to say that the final chapter in the superman series was a big let down is an understatement. i have read many peoples opinion on this movie and agree that it could have been a way better film. though the films theme does have some merit attached to it. superman iv is about the man of steel grappling with his emotions of his now home planet, earth. he is afraid the planet could suffer the same fate as his mother planet krypton. superman agrees to rid the planet of the threat of nuclear war. but the mastermind of the greatest criminal in the modern era, lex luthor, uses the superman peace bid to create ciaos. his new creation is a frankenstein like being, a nuclear man. can superman stop the earth from blowing itself up? actors such as christopher reeve and gene hackman were crazy when they agreed to do this film. i know that reeve helped to write the story to this film, and the whole nuclear war theme was quite fine. but tell me if i am wrong, the big screen version never turned out the way it was suppose to? reeve was good again as clark kentsuperman but only when his feet were on the ground. the flying sequences in this superman were atrocious. scenes like when lois lane and superman fly around together. these scenes look fake. the original superman gave me the impression that this bloke really could fly. but this film makes a mockery of the superman name. i must commend the speech of superman to the world congress on nuclear war, it was quite touching and when you watch the movie up to this point, i thought hey this might be alright. but how wrong was i? gene hackman made the role of lex luthor his own. yet, i am amazed he even wanted anything to do with reprising the luthor role. not that he was bad, but the film itself was. hackman since then, has had to reinvent himself in films like enemy of the state, which i enjoyed immensely. it is only lucky he didnt ruin his whole career. another of his better films was the quick and the dead, starring alongside hollywood beauty sharon stone. margot kidder was back in superman iv and i did enjoy parts of her in this. lois emotions towards superman were well acted by kidder. looking at kidders career since this film nothing really stands out to me though. margot has had bad luck in the last ten years, being in a serious car crash, managing maniac depression and requiring psychiatric care. i do remember that she went through a tough trot. i will tell you which cast members werent quite that super. first of all, nuclear man mark pillow. it is fine to have a menacing look about you, but arent you suppose to able to act a bit also? pillow was a terrible choice in this role. the other point is that i havent seen or heard anything of this guy since. the other crappy part to his role was that gene hackman supplied the voice of his character. the nuclear man character was ok, but could have had a better actor playing him. then you have the attractive actress mariel hemingway, who played lacy warfield. the daughter of tycoon david warfield sam wanamaker. as good looking as hemingway is, her character in this was of no importance at all. likewise wanamaker, who just makes up the numbers, plus the whole take over bid of the daily planet didnt make much sense to me. last of all i want to talk about jon cryer. he played luthors nerdy nephew, lenny. he was terrible and a complete waste of time being in this film in my view. i also read somewhere, has anyone seen jon cryer since superman iv? my answer to that is yes, in a film titled holy man starring would you believe eddie murphy, jeff goldblum and the gorgeous kelly preston. i have mentioned some scenes in superman iv that i liked and that i disliked. another favourite was when lacy and lois had a double date with clark and superman. this scene was well acted and cleverly done. superman was up and down this tall building for the entire scene. reeves talents again shone through with this. the only problem with this scene was that it totally gives away who supermans secret identity really is. anyone in their right mind should know after having a double date with the guy. the worst scene in the film is when nuclear man takes lacy warfield after falling in love with her. superman discovers that nuclear mans energy comes from the sun and shifts the moons orbit to block the sun. meanwhile lacy is dragged into outer space. i dont know who got this wrong, but no earthling can breathe in space without help can they? so why didnt lacy die huh? the other dilemma this film had was that the budget was cut back. after a test screening, it was reduced from 134 to 90 minutes. i say that the edit button destroyed this film. scenes were deleted or cut. it might i stress might have helped if i could have seen the whole film. i read the book to superman iv and admit that i actually enjoyed reading it. i hope we get to see what was taken out of this film on the dvd of superman iv. all in all this was a movie which probably never had a chance to succeed. with poor special effects, ordinary cast and a shortened version that really did kill it. i want to wish christopher reeve all the best in his recovery from his quadriplegia. i will always remember him as superman, on the big screen and in real life. i am afraid to say that this film gave superman a bad name. rating 2 out of 5 stars or 410.",negative
"sights and sounds the cinematography for this movie is pretty bad. the camerawork isnt all the great. the visual presentation is below average and makes this movie even more boring. there arent a lot of effects, but for the most part they are hideously bad. characters all the characters are actually somewhat decent. the acting is ok. some of the actors are worse than others. this movie tries to have several very dramatic and sad scenes that are a bit undercut by the subpar acting. if the actors were better, id probably have been closer to tears but asis i was laughing. geography for some reason the people making this movie didnt take into account the world when they were making it. germany, washing dc, alaska, and california are nowhere near as close to each other as they seem to think. also, you cant drive a car from california to italy which im assuming is what they did. there is no implication that they flew, and im pretty sure that captain america doesnt have a valid passport. plot the plot is ok, but the problem is that its executed very sloppily. if youre not paying very close attention, nothing is going to make any sense. overall, the sequence of events in this movie are pretty random. language there are a few scenes where people arent speaking english. for some reason, only about every other line is subtitled. just random parts of the conversation are translated. i dont care if the germans are speaking german, just make up your mind wether or not you want us englishspeakers to understand. overall, this a poorly made, boring movie. its not really worth to watch as a sobadthatitsgood movie because its not even that funny except for a few wtf moments.",negative
"dont get me wrong, i am not a fan of jason friedburg or aaron seltzer, in fact i go out of my way to avoid their films. i was only marginally entertained by scary movieim sure most of which all had to do with the wayans brothers, and abhorred the sequel. i saw scary movie 4but not the third movie just to pass the time with a friend, and despite maybe one joke that workedsort of. its the one where a ray gun disintegrates everyones clothes, i was utterly bored. date movie was another film i saw almost out of some obligation to watch whatever dvd my pop collects, and the film was horrible and monotonous, and worst of all, boring. there is nothing worse than a bad comedy. i didnt follow up on epic movie, superhero movie, disaster movie, and i will probably never watch anything else by these hacks again. in between all this garbage however, is meet the spartans, which isnt as shallow or tedious as their other films. actually, some of the jokes work, and that is because this film has the good sense to wield sex as its arbitrator of humor. not all, mind you, but a surprising amount of the humor works, which is a lot of gay jokes, as greeks are famous for their comfort with homosexuality inmany instances. there are also jokes intended for the red blooded male in mind. i was surprised at how the actors actually put conviction into these jokes, as if they actually are trying to entertain the audience. if it is on a base level, at least it is a pleasurable one. also, there are a few dance numbers in here which entertained me, and the reason i liked them is because they were silly, out of left field, and not as mean spirited as friedburgseltzer skits usually are. also, i think that they inadvertently raised the level of craftsmanship by placing the story in a historical context. even if you know nothing about the greeks outside of 300, at least that makes you aware that there is life outside of vapid popular culture. oh sure, there are plenty of cringe worthy references to celebrities and american idol, but than again, what were you expecting from this movie?",negative

"so far, this show is pretty great love the tango dance at the beginning and the tango theme music throughout. theres plenty of laugh out loud moments and interesting storylines. yes, i could do without the laugh track, so hopefully that will change. the oddball son and brother of mandy does take some getting used to, maybe the show needs more time to develop his character. some sitcoms have very predictable plots but this show does not. will sasso is a gem and is always funny. there is chemistry between frankie and mandy is good. its great that the show sometimes brings in the other characters from young sheldon.",positive

"moana was one of my favorite animation movies, right up there with kung fu panda and ratatouille. i didnt expect moana 2 to live up to that standard, and still was slightly disappointed. the biggest issue the music. the original moana had so many songs that just hit you, moved you, pulled at a thread in your soul, and stayed with you. moana 2? nah, not a single one that even got near that level. a real letdown. then the editing, especially for the first part of the movie, felt a bit rushed. it was like they werent giving scenes enough time to unfold, but instead trying to squeeze them into a pace for the sake of having some plot elements in there, but not caring enough about how they sink in. felt like storytelling at the speed of tiktok, except that on tiktok, it works because you come for the 10second clip, whereas in the movie, it just felt careless. the one thing this movie did well was raising the stakes, particularly towards the end of the movie. a few scenes where you could feel the audience really getting sucked into the story.",positive

"with three exclamation points you know im serious. the movie could have been the so bad its good type if i didnt have a strong desire to punch the actors in the face. from now on they need to do a quick punchability test before allowing people to be in movies. walk them through a public area and ask people to rate how badly they want to punch the actor in the face 110 scale, its hard to take anyone seriously while you are thinking about how satisfying it would be to punch him in the face. the plot isnt really worth mentioning outside of the fact that at one point the guys in the movie face off in a battle of masculinity by swinging rakes at each other. i was going to attempt something humorous about the rake fighting but i thought the fact that they were rake fighting is funny enough. no need to call the retarded kid stupid i guess. i fail to understand any of the character but i suppose its all for the better. one girl is a prude and yet her boyfriend stays with her? one girl is a slut but has a puchability rating of 8.4 not to be confused with her hitability rating of a mere 4.2, sad. the macho guy as proved via mild garden tool swinging is a pain in the ass military guy with a scoobydoo van. finally the main character is a skinny kid who needs to brush up on his rake skills and has a shocking punchability of 9.8!! nearly perfect for face punching! then some other stuff happens and it all sucks thats all",negative

nay they battle to see who can be the most embarrassing actor. and the battle is fierce. you think youve stomached flat, tone deaf, emotionally gyroscopic overacting before? not like this. not. like. this! as they open their mouths, words tumble out. words arranged so impenetrably ornately, so indefatigably nonsensical, so riotously wretched, that they extend beyond the screen like creeping poltergeist claws, and vigorously disembowel any viewer despicable enough to be within reach. over time, the words feed off the despair of their listeners, accruing more malevolent mass, and becoming monologues. monologues, anointing affleck his true title of the sultan of slick, christening lopez queen dykeosaurusrexy, and, in a feat of tarantinotheft that would defy belief if everything else in this movie hadnt already defied belief out of the dictionary, explaining the process of digital orb extrusion in tai moi chai. at this point, logical thought is a distant whiff of a memory, scattered like grains of sand in the ocean of afflecks hair product. youd want to let out a silent scream. but affleck and lopez have stolen all the words. and all you can do is babble. but lo! a bright star emerges! here, we are visited by a kindly extraterrestrial from the planet walken. concealing his fear behind his bugeyed cheshire cat grin, he attempts to approximate conventional human parlance to warn you of the dangers that ensue from prolonged exposure. but your brain has already eroded too much to decipher the coded messages hidden in his talk of ice cream and pie. desperate, he croaks out a final warning of giglis most devastating side effect your tongue will slap your brains out trying to get to it! but it is too late. the final brain slap has begun. you fester in your own sick in this purgatory of giglis apartment, slobbering and gibbering like a lobotomized bulldog, as the strains of inappropriately saccharine romantic synth music form a dubstep remix with the word baywatch, and jackhammer a gong in your cavernous skull. here, the movie sinks in for the kill. you hear bartha utter the phrase penis sneeze, but you are numb. you see every other woman in the film reduced to a boorishly flirtatious or hysterical, whimsically suicidal lesbian caricature, but you are numb. hell, you even sit through the final hallucinogenic indignity of al pacino?!, clad in a talking heads oversized suit, actually trying ??!?! to infuse some class or energy into the film. but you are numb. numb, because you have sat through two of the most stupefying monologues in cinema history. behold ben afflecks fistpumping ode to the penis, and jennifer lopezs yogic aria to the vagina. with their powers combined, the film finally filibusters any remaining brain cells out of your head. he turns her straight, 1964 james bond style?! you would normally incredulously gripe. normally. but by the time you reach the sanctuary of baywatch, its too late. your motor functions have run their course you are more vegetable than human now. the brain slap is complete. if only youd listened to walken, emissary from a faraway galaxy. he would have warned you about gigli namely, that the effects of consumption approximate, in the words of the beloved douglas adams, having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. but there is no gold here. only pain. only suffering. now if you had a chance of preventing this fate, dear viewer. if you could turn back time, and avoid drinking in this unfathomable chasm of universal offensiveness, this abominable void of oblivion. if you could save not only yourself, but the world as you know it. if you could take the hype not as a comedic, drunken challenge, but as a dire, chilling warning. would you be, in the words of walken, interested?

"dazed and confused might not leave you dazed not even confused on what richard linklater wanted to express in his recollection of his 1976 youth memories with the last day of high school as a backdrop in some texan town. what he wanted to show is obvious a slice of teenagers and young adults life at the eve of the summer holidays, when those who leave are at the top of the hierarchy and the future newcomers going through a rite of passage... literally. the cultclassic highlights a reality that only someone still in touch with kids like a teacher can truly see, they do need a social hierarchy and a system as much as adults. indeed, in that pivotal period between childhood and adulthood, theres a need to be part of it, that it grandpa simpson used to be with, until he didnt know what it was. think of it, why do we call them the best years of our lives? why is fashion or music generally made by and for it? because theres one thing the young knows, he must distance himself from his childhood, which means from the parents, the parents stop being the perspective, they become objects of the kids perspective. now, all it takes is to extend the parents to any semblance of authority and you got it, kids refuse the authority or discipline not because they feel they dont need it, but because they feel a more urgent need to challenge it, because thats how they structure their identity. all these elements of rebellion are essential aspect of youth, whether its against your football coach calling your buddies a loser, a teenager breaking the curfew, drinking beer before legal age, smoking pot or whatever, or simply questioning the learnings from school, rebellion is essential... many of these kids arent armed to face the world, not yet, their views are confused indeed, but the idea of creating that social microcosm where they can be themselves is all worth it. like fashion, from the black leather jackets in the 50s to the hippies in the 60s, punk or the new wave, fashion is what outdates the adults, what makes them out of touch, belonging to the past while fashion is the expression of the moment, no past, no consequences then no future, dazed and confused has long hair, afros, flared trousers high heels, while its only long hair and maybe sideburns for the parents. notice that even the 1415 kids dress like them but their momentum hasnt come yet, compromised by their age, by the fact that they can barely drink without falling asleep, by the fact that some are still not interested in girls and would take kissing and making out as enough an achievement. thats the irony of the young adults, with teenagers, they feel like adults, with adults, they can enjoy them being careless. as a matter of fact, a great line can speak a thousand word, it comes from matthew mcconaughey and has become the signature thats what i love about these high school girls, man. i grow older, they stay the same age. these guys enjoy the idea of having grown up, of being at the peak of their youth and big enough to act like parent figures, the rebellion isnt complete if you didnt take the role of the parents and heres why the hazing scenes are important. when the girls put pacifiers in their victims mouths, its a subconscious maternal instinct working, when the boys are spanked, its not much humiliation than relegating them to a childhood that is their only perceptible status among the almighty elders. but these comingofage rites are less meant as regressions for the teenagers than consecrations to the adults. for instance, when the girls are soiled literally with mustard and ketchup and then symbolically when theyre forced to say dirty words, its still all part of a game actually, if that wasnt unsuitable it wouldnt be fun, theyre like little girls putting on mommys heel shoes, in a later scene, when young sabrina is caught flirting with an older guy, the drunk darla parker posey throws one hell of a tantrum and promises to make her life a living hell, similarly with ben afllecks obannon when he gets his comeuppance and cant accept it, spanking kids is okay but being splattered by painting is a blow to his dominating ego. both darla and obannon take their status so seriously that its not even a game anymore and they cross a sort of terroristfascist line in the way they alienate people according to their status. and when you have a nice guy like adam goldbergs character assaulted just one word too many, you get the catch of the whole game, mommy and daddy not here to protect you. preparing us to the harsh realities of the world, with its tyrants, injustices and victims, youth is a required passage. as a teacher, i know my authority is challenged more than often and then i see them acting together in the school yard and i realize their paradoxes they reject authority but they have their hierarchies those who get the girls, those who can fight, they reject their parents but enjoy acting like parent figures. now, i dont think the relevance is in the historical context despite its terrific soundtrack, the film screams young more than seventies... but i think what linklaters comingofage film proposes is a real sociology of youth, even more effective than american graffiti because theres no plot, not even subplots..... but if we were to draw some parallels with todays pre2020 years, now that we have cellphones, internet, social networks... when you cant see where the hits come from and cant totally separate yourself from the world, let alone the authority figures... maybe today is even more dazing and confusing",negative

"the adventures of shark boy and lava girl in 3d was barely advertised. i just happened to see the trailer for it because i worked at nielsen and got to see the trailer when we were testing it. i also saw the trailer once again in kicking and screaming but other than that, i never saw any advertising for the film. therefore, i didnt really know what to expect when walking into the theater today to see the adventures of shark boy and lava girl. the adventures of shark boy and lava girl is about a boy named max cayden boyd who has a vivid imagination and is a big dreamer. in his dreams, he creates shark boy taylor lautner and lava girl taylor dooley. one day in class, max tells his class the story of shark boy and lava girl, but the class doesnt believe a word of it and just makes fun of him. after class, max gets in a fight with linus jacob davich who takes maxs dream book. you see max keeps all his dreams written in a book so he always remembers them. when max, goes home that night he wishes that he doesnt have to return to school but of coarse that doesnt happen. however, the next day something interesting happens, shark boy and lava girl show up at school and seek maxs help max then goes with shark boy and lava girl and this is where the fun filled adventure begins. one thing i can say about robert rodriguez is that he has a knack for filmmaking. he makes movies that are both creative and have unique stories. i actually liked this film better then spy kids 3d but not as much as the original spy kids or spy kids 2. however, in a robert rodriguez film once you throw in the 3d element you lose a little story. but this doesnt make the film bad or any less enjoyable. what amazes me about mr. rodriguez is how he can make films like sin city and once upon a time in mexico and also make great family films such as the spy kids series and this film. i dont understand why critics hated this movie but then again i dont always understand the critics. when watching a movie like shark boy and lava girl, you have to remember one thing that this is a movie made for the enjoyment of little kids. so if you think in that mindset you will really enjoy it. its extremely creative and unique. its a movie where your imagination can run wild. if you get into the film, you feel like youre a little kid again and thats a great feeling. if you go into the theater expecting a cinematic gem youre not going to get it. the acting isnt as good as it was in the spy kids movies or any of robert rodriguezs other work. the story is decent but wont blow you away. however the film is visually appealing and is fun for people with vivid imaginations. like i said, go into the movie and take the movie for what it is, a great family popcorn flick that both adults and kids together can enjoy if you put your mind to it. so in conclusion, if you go into the adventures of shark boy and lava girl knowing what to expect you will really enjoy the film. its like spy kids 3d but slightly better because its more visually interesting and the story is better. i always enjoy mr. rodriguezs movies and this one is no different. his directing technique is amazing and he manages to make films for cheap no matter how large the cast or amount of special effects. this movie is a lot of fun and is well worth the trip to the multiplex. its a great film to bring the kids to and their eyes will be glued to the screen for the entire 95 minutes. i think if you enjoyed the spy kids series then you will probably enjoy this film as well. its a fun film that is truly underrated. moviemanmenzels final rating for the adventures of shark boy and lava girl in 3d is a 710.",negative
"i was quite disappointed when i started to watch tvf pitchers on youtube, as lots of dialogs are in hindi. my safari browser only gives me the transcript option, which doesnt make up for lacking subtitles. so i converted the transcript via bbedit with grep to an srt file and watched the first 3 episodes with vlc player. unluckily episodes 4 and 5 are only placed on the tvf site, but without transcripts ... okay, now about contents this series would get a 9 or 10 from me, if it was easier for a nonindian german to watch. the plot reminds me extremely of silicon valley though on some different levels it is not a situpcomedy but still quite humorous it is not yet? placed in a silicon valley ambiance but delivers fascinating insights into indian everyday circumstances actually up to now it does not treat any actual softwarehardware product but focuses on the process of selling a hypothetical undefined idea characters are less shiny than in sv but its easier to identify with their nerdness... all in all, its fun to watch but hard to get at for a nonhindi speaker. how shall i ever understand dialogs in episodes 4 and 5 ?!?",positive

"when people say this is the worst movie ever they imply that they saw a movie. a movie has two essential parts 1. a plot and 2. acting. troll 2 has neither. so technically troll 2 is not a movie. therefore, i say this is the worst thing that ever happened in my life. and for the record troll 2 has no trolls, it has goblins, ha! my dog once asked me i am going to make a movie. i said to him youre a dog. dogs dont make movies. after seeing troll 2 i said to him go on and make your movie. ive seen a lot of crap. believe me. ive become an expert in this field. and troll 2 doesnt belong in my field of expertise. because i watch movies. i like movies. i comment movies. troll 2 is not a movie. troll 2 is like just before you die. the same feeling. its when you say damn, a whole life wasted. i wasted my life after watching it. i have no longer desire to live, to love, to hate, to feel. i have become totally numb. people ask me whats wrong with me, but im too embarrassed to say that i lost my desire to live because of troll 2. this is why, instead of writing a constructive comment, ill make a public warning troll 2 is good only, if you are suicidal. troll 2 is good only, if you hate people. troll 2 is good only, if you lost your faith in humanity. troll 2 is good only, if you no longer respect yourself. troll 2 is good only...troll 2 is good for nothing. dont see it, youll go blind. dont try to understand it, youll go insane. dont try to rent it, youll be sorry. dont recommend it, people who love you will love you no more. dont try to download it, your pc will die on you. dont think about it at all or youll end up just like me. potential consequences in case and i hope this never happens you see it your girlboyfriend will leave you. youll lose your job. youll have no prospect in life whatsoever. nothing will be the same ever again, not even your appearance. youll gain weight, lose your hair, become impotent, start drinking, start liking paris hilton. my last appeal is in gods name, in the name of everything and everyone you love dont watch this. dont be even tempted. i know that what is forbidden is appealing, but dont follow your instincts, dont listen to your curious nature. just dont. and everything will be fine. and the world will be the way it is. better off without troll 2.",negative

"ive never read a captain america comic book. but i dont have to to know that any fan of the comic wont be too pleased with this film. matt salinger does his best with a lousy story. captain america doesnt even finish one mission before hes frozen in ice, only to be thawed out 50 years later. the red skull is the villain, but in most of the movie he looks like a guy with acne problems. however, we do learn that the red skull had a hand in the jfk assassination. how oliver stone missed that lead is beyond me. the captains super powers seem to be limited to throwing his shield and faking car sickness. on the positive side, at times the film does have the feel of a 40s serial. i wouldve liked to see that carried out, but the film never decides whether to be serious or kindofcorny. instead it just ends up being boring.",negative

"i dont know about storks but i sure will be returning to this show again. matter of fact, this is my second time watching it and im loving it all the same. as a croat, i hate to say it but serbs are 10 leagues ahead of us when it comes to tv shows and films. vratice se rode is a perfect example. what a rollercoaster of laughs and tears! spectacular series with a healthy amount of twists, brilliant writing, impressive acting and then some more. a natural blend of humour and art, as it should be, with iconic scenes that will be remember for decades whres killed an honest man!. the starring heroes form a triangle with all characters caught up in their own dreams. some are trapped in the pursuit of richness dule, some in pursuit of love svaba, and some dont even know what theyre after ekser. all three are brilliant actors with widely acclaimed appearances and one of them recently lost a 3year old son, a tragic ordeal nobody deserves. thank you for this series. clearly a lot of work has gone into it and everything checks out. the plot is a tad slow but gets you there, the cinematography is more than solid and the soundtrack is beyond spectacular. but most importantly, the human element is just there, man. when ekser opened up about feeling as if being happy just isnt him, it hit hard. then, i fell of my chair again when dule opened his mouth. altogether this is what tv is all about. a series that challenges, engages, entertains, and is in essence a mockery of itself one that leaves you guessing whether you should cry or laugh. or, what the hell, you might as well do both thats life anyway.",positive
"although this movie has amassed a cult reputation as one of the worst movies ever made, its not really inept enough to justify even a cursory look. true, the title song has a certain zingy bounce to it that promises hilarity and for a while there it seems we might be in for a mild spoof on christmassy movies or even a sendup of day the earth stood still. alas, despite the expenditure of a fair bit of money on sets and costumes, every plot opening turns into a dead end. admittedly, not the worst movie ever made but it tries mighty hard to reach that distinction. if the script was meant to be joked up or played tongueincheek, almost the entire cast seems unaware of that fact. in fact, john call and leonard hicks are offered some really splendid comic opportunities but both seem relentlessly bent on playing the script straight, despite prodding by vincent beck and bill mccutcheon plus don blair in a small part as the television news announcer to follow their examples. mr call in particular deserves some sort of commendation for his successful efforts to rob the role of any satiric humor, although mr websters unhelpfully leaden direction must also cop a fair share of the blame.",positive

"the fix is in, the odds are set, and the boys are ready to play for the big time, both on the screen and behind the camera in this breezy, endlessly entertaining movie classic. robert redford is smalltime hustler johnny hooker, happy to play the marks in joliet until the murder of his mentor pushes him to go up against the nastiest mug in chicago, doyle lonnegan robert shaw. hookerd rather ice lonnegan outright, but will settle for a big con with the help of a slightly wobbly but game scammer named henry gondorff, played as only paul newman can. newman and redford, along with director george roy hill, had a lot riding on this pony, given it was a followup to their earlier butch cassidy and the sundance kid. to measure up, they had to produce nothing short of another classic. and so they did. the sting won the best picture oscar in 1973, and remains the sentimental favorite among many in choosing between the two films. comparing the sting to butch cassidy is kind of overdone sport, and tempers, as lonnegan would say, run hot. but you can see why the sting worked as well as it did by looking at how the director and the stars played it differently within the same basic framework as butch cassidy. newman and redford are again outlaws and underdogs. period detail abounds here as it did with butch cassidy, and theres another memorable score amid the proceedings, scott joplin rags modernized by marvin hamlisch. the score even produced another hit, the entertainer, to compare with raindrops keep falling on my head. whats different about the sting, and what makes it such a classic in its own right, is the way the stars service the plot. in butch cassidy, newman and redfords comradeship was the story. here, the chemistry between the two actors is minimized in favor of spinning a yarn with enough red herrings to feed the swedish navy. the tale here is better than butch cassidy, which is a more elegiac film with grander cinematography and funnier set pieces. the sting is an edgeofyourseat caper flick from beginning to end. you cant really call the sting a comedy. though there are many laughs, especially when newman hooks shaw during a poker game, hill wont let the audience relax enough for that. what this is is a con game, played on the audience, designed not to cheat but entertain by means of clever hoodwinking and constant misdirection plays. youll get no spoilers from me. this is one worth sitting through with no expectations. five gets you ten youll enjoy newman and redford, and a terrific supporting cast one advantage over butch cassidy that includes charles durning, eileen brennan, dana elcar, harold gould, and mr. hand himself, ray walston. theres another familiar face from butch cassidy, charles dierkop, flat nose curry in butch cassidy and lonnegans right hand here. the best performance may be robert shaws he exudes menace aplenty but some humanity, too, when he takes hooker under his wing after learning he came from the same hard streets of five points lonnegan sprang from. terrific period detail, too. the dialogue is great and feels real in its runyonesque way, while the cons are elaborate and logically played out. watching this a second time is especially fun because once you know how the plot goes down, you find yourself catching clues you missed the first time, and enjoying the film even more for them. why didnt newman and redford team up again? certainly there was another good movie for them to partner up in, but as gondorff would have put it, only chumps dont quit when theyre ahead.",positive

"i skipped the trailer, was blind to the cast and the plot. within a few minutes, i was glad, because this was surprising, entertaining and fresh. as new characters were revealed, some kept me guessing as to who the stars were. for instance, coleman domingo! who knew? so many alisters, i gave up counting. thats what imdb is for. the soundtrack had me hooked from the start, especially mother. this world was not populated with the usual shiny, pristine hightech robotics, but vintage, retro, scuffed up metallic creatures that reminded me of tin toys that are pulled from dusty old attics on american pickers. the size of some of the robots, and the desert landscapes that they inhabited were a feast for my imagination. the humor is subtle, and nonstop. it merits a second viewing to catch all the zingers. i wont bother to name the stars or directors, as any of you readers have probably seen the whole cast list by now. i kept asking myself, why didnt they bother to release this in theaters? netflix puts out great series and movies, that could easily be shown on the big screen. we are just spared seeing tiein commercials for the movie on taco bell, mcdonalds, or volkswagen. another thing, i watched this on my big screen in daylight, and will have to rewatch it in a dark room to see more details, and really feel it. ill leave you with one final comment that i will paraphrase, twinkies with beans, what kind of beans?",positive

"well what could i say about this film that hasnt been said before. its arguably the best peanuts specialfilm, a christmas classic, and probably something many people across generations have childhood nostalgia for even if their parents werent alive at its original release. this was the first peanuts animated special and set such a precedent for holiday classic for generations. with a message that still transcends into the 21st century. its not just about christmas and the crass commercialization of christmas or holiday season, but its about the ennui individuals experience when their ideals and values clash the mass culture around them. charlie brown feels lost, but ends up finding joy again as those around him help pick up and remind each other why they are all together in the first place. i think that while this film has a christianchristmas theme, it does not take away from the shared feelings people can experience during the holiday season.",positive
a real pain is probably the most wholesome movie dealing with surprisingly difficult subject matters that ive seen since the holdovers. i was totally shocked at the truly dark places this movie went to without ever sacrificing being a very entertaining time with moments that i found to be totally fulfilling. its much heavier than i expected it to be but it never stopped being captivating and i always wanted to see where this dysfunctional relationship was going to go next. its not the flashiest movie from a visual perspective but it is very well paced and at only 90 minutes i cant say there was a single moment of wasted screen time. it starts in a way that allows the characters to be very vulnerable and the slow reveal of their inner issues was something i found to be very satisfying. for all of the hype ive heard about kieran culkin in this movie i was still amazed at how powerful his performance was. it very much plays like a character designed to steal the movie but it never came across as obnoxious because of how authentically he played these scenes. he is absolutely hilarious in a way thats likely to remind people of roman roy but hes also a very tragic figure that i managed to feel real empathy for. with it revolving around a holocaust tour there are more than a few sequences that come across as very heavy but i loved the minimalistic way in which eisenberg captured those moments. he lets the images speak for themselves and the moments in which he chose to completely remove sound i found to be very powerful. i also loved the dialogue here in large part because it never felt like dialogue. the conversations feel totally authentic and as if the audience are just a fly on the wall for real people coming to terms with their own issues. for as much as i praise eisenberg as a writer and director here i cant help but feel as if i wanted a bit more out of the character he plays. it comes very much across as a character weve seen eisenberg play before but i also wish he got a bit more of a character arc. it really feels as if most of his purpose is to worry for the kieran culkin character rather than having any discernible issues of his own and it did leave me wanting by the time the film was over. a real pain ended up giving me the exact feeling i wanted it to while also managing to surprise me with the truly dark territory it explores. kieran culkin gives a performance that i would honestly consider to be perfect and i loved seeing this central relationship unfold. its the exact type of movie i love to see with a big group of people and its that rare film i believe i could watch again regardless of what mood i happen to be in.,positive

"the jokes and comical moments are all performed in such an incredible high pace and very well timed and choreographed. the comical moments follow each other very rapidly. big overthetop hilarious situations as well as small subtle ones. you have no time to think about the one joke, since the next one is already occurring at that very moment. the movie is that fast going. blink once and youll miss something funny. this is slapstick filmmaking at its very best. charles chaplin performs his role with great charisma and agility, its a quite psychical movie for him. the movie features jumping, falling and climbing, as you would obviously expect from a 30s slapstick movie. i must admit that a few of the chaplin movies dont live up to their reputations but this one on the other hand really does. its certainly one of the best comedies of the 30s and of all time. a true timeless comedy classic! but as you would expect from a chaplin movie, it also is a movie with lots of heart and humanity. no matter how crazy the movie gets in parts, the movie never loses any of its credibility when it comes down to its drama and pureness. the movie is also made in a more realistic style, rather than a comical one that clearly and also predictably builds up toward a comical situations. this makes the movie all the more hilarious and strengthens the comical moments. the movie just doesnt only rely on its jokes and chaplin antics but also has a great and compelling story of its own. its a quite well written story, that moves over to a lot of different places and locations throughout and is therefore also loaded with lots of characters and situations. it makes the movie also very original. an absolute delightful movie! 1010 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com",positive

"due to poor casting the lead female protagonist derailed the whole set. overdramatic movie. far from reality which the movie boasts to be. the veil is a bad thing. respecting husband is bad. lighting lamp in temple is bad. i dont who was the moron who told the director that women in villages cant cook the food they like. they just cook what other family members like. maybe the film maker does not like to prefer family over herself, but in bharat people put family before self. the character manju mai was put deliberately to pinch hindu beliefs. also the whole setup was done to defame age old hindu traditions which was reflected at each step in movie. it was completely unnecessary. could have been avoided. at the end you will realize this was a total waste of time. i am giving 3 stars for the location as i like villages and small railway stations. overall, poor pathetic and filthy approach. funded from somewhere just to fill indian youth with misinformation against ages old hindu traditions.",positive

"when the final cut spun in some back room, i wonder what scorsese thought he had here, a comedy, a thriller, a drama. this movie has a little bit of everything, but the sum of its parts adds up to very little. very little that we as movie goers have not already seen 100 times before and nothing that i necessarily needed to sit through 168 minutes to see again. the lack of a conscience, the drive to make money at all costs, these are things we all already associate with wall street. so when leo takes his messed up principles and quickly turns his smooth talking ways into millions of dollars, the audience says to itself, ok, now what? how will the story turn dark, how will the greed and booze catch up to these guys, because it always does, right. wrong. the plot here floats at the surface to allow the merry pranksters of leo and jonah hill to basically do whatever it is they want throughout the entire movie. the parties and intoxication are normally something i love, its fun to watch people party and do drugs at least for me. here, the excess becomes tiresome, and that would be fine, if the film was intended to show the perils of excess. but thats not the intent, the negative effects of the drugs is touched upon, and as the plot slowly veers toward the end for our wild wall street bunch, the drugs naturally move the plot deeper down the rabbit hole, but its too much after awhile and thus the film becomes a caricature of itself. a comedic display of excess that the viewer may enjoy like an exaggerated drawing, but not something that has any staying power. scorsese may have realized this, so the plot meanders through fbi investigations, ship wrecks off the coast of italy and swiss bank fraud. its the classic example of throwing too much at the window and hoping something sticks. i found the plot to be unnecessarily bloated, i found the story to be largely superficial, and i found the actual direction to not be nearly as good as scorseses past films. leo and jonah are fantastic, some of the bit actors are good, but there is no real story here. its just a party with consequences that do not seem to bother the characters and therefore, never really create any tension in the narrative. its an enjoyable film at best, a plodding, repetitive, shell of a movie at worst. you be the judge.",positive
"anyone interested in filmliterature theories would approve of this french directors view, that life is mostly composed of haphazard events and insignificant incidents. amelie is brilliant as a film, since it dives into that aspect of life which is regularly overlooked but always pivotal details. how peoples destinies are decided by funny accidents moreover, how the narrator of the film spies and comments on everything makes us constantly aware of the fictionality of the film. this film is a great fictional work which is ridiculously honest about its fictionality, yet feels so real... maybe exactly because of this modest yet genius approach. this is definitely a creative outlook and a refined one which suits the postmodern era were living in.",negative

"ok, now that the court case is over verdict accidental selfmutilation, we can confess. we did it as a joke, really. our friend had said that he thought troll 2 was ok, so we switched that dvd out for from justin to kelly, just for a giggle. i mean, how were we to know? and then he watched it while we were all in the next room. the first 2 minutes were ok, and then it happened. he suddenly jumped out of his chair, running around the room, tore of his shorts and chewed off his own nuts! then, screaming wildly, he ran across the room, right through the plate glass french windows, and made his way across the road, dripping blood and yelling wildly. he then rubbed his face rapidly across the barbed wire fence and was whacking himself on the back of the head with a mediumsized rock, screaming, take it away! no more, no more! please, no more! imagine our surprise when he then ran into the road and mooned an oncoming 18wheeler which flattened him. when we reached him, he was on the ground, oozing blood, bones sticking out from everywhere but he seemed happy. he was whispering, thank you god, thank you. apart from the irreversible brain damage, severe tic and desire to eat possum vomit laced with razor blades he says it helps the pain, doctors are hopeful that he will live out his life in mediocrity. the morphine and thorazine is helping. funny thing is, when we crush his fingers with pliers just for fun, he thinks hes on miami beach and breaks into the most godawful songs about someone called kelly! weird. swat arrived minutes after what we now refer to as, the incident, cordoned the neighborhood and after a few hours, managed to remove from justin to kelly from the dvd player with only a few casualties and four suicides when one of the team accidentally hit the play button on the dvd. last we heard, the disk is under heavy guard by the dod and is being called, the most devastating weapon known to mankind. did you know the average iq of planet earth is a mere 34? when the us ripped off the british tv show stars in their eyes and relabeled it, american idol, the iq dropped another 5 points. when they tried grubbing a few more greenbacks by making from justin to kelly it dropped another 10 points. my take is this any moron who not only watches american idol, but then deliberately goes out and watches a movie made about american idol, deserves exactly what they get. this is proof positive that there is no limit to human stupidity.",negative

"an open letter to mr. michael myers. dear mr. myers. i am writing to inform you that its the sign of the times and i think you should read and understand what it clearly means in regards to your....career. the years have come and go but unfortunately they have not been kind to cinema and society in general. the reason im writing this letter is because i feel that deep in my heart you should seriously consider throwing in the towel and find something else worthwhile pursuing maybe philanthropy perhaps? if you do that not only will people respect you more but it will also help wash away all memories of those years enduring your crap after crap after crap movies. although i cant see how this can possibly happen overnight if fate and the universe persists, it will be a sigh of relief if it was all the more true. memories. oh how profoundly fond those memories are and i recall watching waynes world when i was teenyweeny with a more less jaded view of the world and then came austin powers. ahhh, the laughs those provided to help me drift away from the drudgery of life. then a funny thing happened and the end result was a horrific turn as a pudgy, sexinnuendo laden feline several years ago. in my mind theres no denying that you should have realized that your career tanked at that point for someone once funny to even remotely consider such a perilous career move. the days of austin powers are gone, buddy. grow up and be a man!!! having read the news a while back of your latest endeavor, i hoped that youll rebound after such a dogpileofyouknowwhat of said movie. but alas, my hopes were shattered once again and as i left the theater after witnessing such a travesty of talentless vain proportions, the fragility of my mental state almost reached the breaking point when a good samaritan saved me from what was, to be precise, an almost lifethreatening ordeal. i thanked the good samaritan of course as any sane individual would do and went our separate ways. but i will never, ever, thank you for releasing such soulshattering ineptness garbage that nearly killed me dared to be released for unsuspecting, innocent eyes!!! so in conclusion, after clearing my head of the madness that i suffered, cleansed my spirit as well as my soul, i am now able to return to the outside world once again with the notion that no human being should ever go through such a horrific experience. although i know that time doesnt heal all wounds but it is known that the human spirit is a remarkable thing that not even the likes of you and the evils of hollywood inhabiting the blue and green world cannot comprehend. that special someone, that one individual who saved me from the madness you spewed fourth are moments like these that remind me of the good in the world. and for that, im grateful.",negative

"at the time of writing this slender man currently has an imdb rating of 2.9. for anyone unfamiliar with the site that is incredibly low, for any film of any genre. does the film deserve a rating that low? not in my opinion, no. it is far from a perfect film and has many, many flaws, but what exactly has got it that low i cant say. the first thing youll notice about this film is that it doesnt have the most attractive cast. we are used to horror movies having abnormally beautiful casts with actors and actresses who are perhaps not so great at acting. that really cant be said here and i think it was a good thing for the film. it made the characters feel more real and down to earth mind you considering the subject matter for the film that goes out the window pretty quickly anyway. the films biggest sufferings come in the form of the writing. for one thing there are far too many dream sequences. i find most horror films have at least one these days unfortunately and that is bad enough. slender man has at least half a dozen and they can be seen coming from a mile away. the dialogue is also especially sloppy in certain scenes. the character of slender man is suitably creepy and definitely good enough to make a film out of. there are a couple of really good jumpscares, but there are a few appallingly bad ones too, like one where a woman simply walks past a character in a library. this is far from a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is also far from being as bad as people seem to be making out. watch it for yourself and make up your own mind i would suggest.",negative
"the two popes, somewhat confusingly, is based upon a play called the pope. as a former play, one sees the need to cast two good actors in the two main roles, and fortunately we get two amazing actors, anthony hopkins as cardinal ratzinger and jonathan pryce as cardinal bergoglio, each of whom become exactly one pope. ratzinger famously chose a life of social and religious conservatism, thinking old ways are the best despite some arguments and evidence to the contrary. bergoglio famously sought for a more liberal approach, always considering the plight of the poor, regardless of geography. there are a few pointed references to the vaticans sex abuse scandals, along with the suggestion that popes are not infallible, no matter how loudly or clearly they are or are not hearing the voice of god. nevertheless, the two popes chooses to mainly offer a lighthearted pas de deux, giving hopkins and pryce multiple opportunities to show off in beautiful buildings or gardens. if one can ignore the historical context and the enormity of the power each pope wields, the two popes could have been sold as notsogrumpy old men, and that could be the most important lesson of the movie it would surely be a blast to have a sandwich and a beer with hopkins and pryce.",positive

"the socalled little tramp was charlie chaplins most beloved onscreen character. the figure, which became a veritable icon worldwide, was created when chaplin worked for mack sennetts famous keystone studios. this was during the silent film era and the tramp was first seen in the onereeler mabels strange predicament in 1914. soon the guy was the star in the studios company of players. chaplin then continued to play his character in more than fifty short films. in full, featurelength productions however, he only appeared four times. in 1927, the jazz singer became the film that introduced the talkies to the world. as expected, it didnt take long until silent movies were practically gone from the silver screen. when chaplin began to prepare a new production in the mid1930s, he was therefore advised to go with the flow. but the great comedian knew that the little tramps appeal would be lost if he had to speak. consequently, chaplin insisted on making the picture without any dialogue. in addition to starring in modern times, charlie chaplin produced and directed the movie himself. he then spent a whole year in his own hollywood studio, shooting the piece after his own screenplay. the films highly stylized look was due to the fact that it was shot with 18 frames per second the standard for silent film but was shown at 24 frames per second the standard for talking pictures. this, of course, made the slapstick comedy even more frantic. many leading critics consider modern times to be charlie chaplins last silent film. even though the director used both sound, vocal and musical effects throughout. still, after more than three years in production, modern times became a great, international success for the director. one of the signature works of his career, even. but sadly, it was also the last time the cinema audience got to see the little tramp up on the silver screen.",positive

"i must concur with the other reviewers who have commented on the eerie accuracy of this film. i too attended high school in texas in the 1970s, and this film is so flawless in recreating this time and place it lends the impression you were being documented without your knowledge. if you are of an age and background that permits you to relate to dazed confused on this level, it will give you an unusual affinity for the film. this is exactly how we dressed and wore our hair, those are the cars we drove, the music we loved, that looks exactly like my high school with only slight variations in paint colors, those seemed to be my teachers, and all of these people were the people i knew then. there is no question but that the author of this piece had to have been one of us. as someone who was there, i hope i can clear up or offer some insight into a few of the points people have raised about the film. the drug use well, it was the 70s. in my high school, really hardcore drugs such as heroin were virtually unknown, we talked about it but never saw it, but both marijuana and lsd were as common and available as sand in your shoes. my generation had a very permissive attitude toward these substances. my own clique would never have had the brass ones required to actually partake on campus, as getting caught would not have meant a detention but a trip to jail on the other hand it was not infrequent to find us stoned in class. but we did leave campus to blow a joint, absolutely, usually in either the home of one of us who lived nearby or a van that belonged to another of our group, parking at the shopping center down the street. in dc we see slater and some of his friends smoking weed right in the schoolyard, that didnt happen in my school. there wasnt a single teacher at my high school who would not have immediately recognized the odor of marijuana and sought out the source. with the clarity of thirty years hindsight, i remain of the opinion that we frankly had a healthier attitude on this subject than do socalled role models of today. bad drug problems are bad drug problems, but the recreational use of marijuana is substantially less detrimental than either alcohol or tobacco, which both get a free pass because theyre legal. marijuana also failed to serve as a gateway drug in our clique, none of us were led by it into harsher substances. im glad im not in high school today. one point of particular discussion i have noticed here on dcs imdb page is the movies rather brutal depiction of hazing, busting the freshmen. several have reported that this did not occur at their school. you were lucky, and be glad of it. i attended high school in dallas in the 1970s and this absolutely was a part of our life. i, like all girls, was spared the brutal whippings that mitch and his friends have inflicted upon them by the seniors, but it absolutely happened to incoming freshmen boys and was generally sanctioned, or at least overlooked, by the adults in charge. for the record, yes it is assualt and battery. dang! what else do you call violently beating someone with a board until they cry? battery, plain and simple. outrageous, mean spirited and cruel, and frankly the homoerotic assfixated nature of this hazing paints a far more unflattering psychological portrait of those dealing out the punishment than of those receiving it. as girls we were at least not physically assaulted, but we did undergo some nasty initiation rituals, but usually only those of us trying to get into an organized club, not just all of us en masse simply because of our age this is also depicted quite accurately in the film, what those poor girls endure from that bitch to get on the cheerleading squad, god love em. and it is likewise plainly obvious in the film just as it was in real life, the senior boys learned this bizarre monkeylike behavior from those bastions of simian progress, their coaches, roles universally filled by academic failures who represent the woodersons of the future. as disturbing as the hazing is, it belongs in the film because it was there, it was real, it was a part of our lives in that time and place, and i felt a delicious satisfaction when that one kids mom met obannion at the front porch cocking a shotgun. i dont think so, creep! you go girl! as both mitch and sabrina deal with the initiation rituals in a manner that is respected by their older peers and grants them access to the cool clique, it is too intrinsic to the storyline to be removed or whitewashed. i might add this is the only movie i have ever seen that captures this. in summation, this is a movie directed at a rather specific audience. my friends who are of dramatically different age or grew up in a different part of the country do not generally relate to this movie nor enjoy it on the same level, although they often find it entertaining. but if you, like the filmmaker, were a texas high school student in those amazingly permissive 1970s, and didnt particularly hate your life at the time, i think youll absolutely love it. highly recommended.",positive

"dont be motivated by the rating of that movie. its biased by the nationalist koreans who want to support their director. ridiculous. koreans are well known for such childish behavior when korea dropped out of the soccer world cup 2006, koreans attacked the fifa server so heavily that fifa had to block all ip addresses from korea ... to put is short, this movie is bad. and boring. this movie is not just a wannabe mix of hollywoods starwars, lord of the rings, black hawk down and jurassic part. no, its a very, very bad wannabe mix of all that. with all respect, mr shim, what have you been doing over the past 5 years of directing that movie ? i think he wanted to do the sort of epic scifi action movie. but for that you need much more than just a cluster of megaflop computers. instead of relying on actors, the director relied on computer power. even worse, the director tries to impress the audience by showing some selected martial art sequences which are nothing but blunt copies of crouchint tiger, hidden dragon. those sequences dont even fit into the overall making style of the movie. for sure we can not reward this director for finding new and innovative ways of actionmovie making. what the scifi action thrillers jurassic parc and co. have in common is at least a decent plot, thrilling moments and some good, authentic acting. but this movie doesnt have any of that. moreover, the actors dont reveal any special characteristic of the person they act. its so sterile. a kiss, what even in mediocre movies is a long suspected and awaited moment comes here as an unexpected sudden and sterile act at the beach ... how romantic the director should have used the computer for the main actors as well, it wouldnt have made any difference and he could have saved time and money. no thrills, no surprising moments, no dramatic, nothing. dont waste your time on that movie. i recommend to rent a dvd of jurassic parc 1 instead. even if you saw that one already 4 times.",negative
"there were so many elements that could have made death of a unicorn a great movie. a dark comedy melded with an unconventional monster movie with paul rudd seems like an obvious home run. but the whole movie never seems to get all its parts to properly gel. the horror aspects are quite impressive and will satisfy most gore frenzied fans. and will poulters performance definitely carries the whole film despite its disjointed script and storytelling. but with most of the cast seemingly undecided on just how far to push the satirical aspects of their characters, it never felt like a true ensemble. this first time director definitely showed how green they were. the unicorns provided some of the best and most disappointing parts of the film. having a unicorn as a true monster was at times a delightfully gory and violent joy. but there were times where the cgi was so bad, it took away any mystique and awe the unicorns had previously established. at this point of cgi animation, how does someone screw up this badly at making a horse run convincingly? the trailer for this movie definitely shows you what it could have been with a better director and screenwriter at the helm. but the full movie doesnt measure up to it. death of a unicorn isnt a bad movie by any means. but when you see how close it came to being great, youll just be left a bit frustrated.",negative

"so my background with this franchise is this i watched the big bang theory from when it started, stopped watching after several seasons, came back to finish the series, moved from there to young sheldon, which was nearing the last season, and enjoyed that. then that show finished, and there was a tremendous amount of promotion for this show. so i gave it a try, and honestly, im so glad i did. the characters are great, the humor is very funny, and the stories are well written. now early on, i guess to build up story, georgie had a tough go. it seemed like they were going to be hard on him in this series, because he was becoming the brunt of a lot of the jokes, and was dealing with health issues. i was like, theyre too hard on him, but luckily, that changed, and the show didnt feel quite as mean as it did in the early episodes. i find this to be one of few shows that makes me laugh out loud, and how often does that happen anymore? not too often. its nice to see characters from young sheldon appear as well, sometimes. that really adds to the world of the show. so, if you like the previous shows related to this one, this one will be right up your alley.",positive

"the electric state is a visually stunning, highbudget scifi adventure that brings together an intriguing premise, a talented cast, and some fantastic worldbuilding. while its far from perfect, the film offers enough charm and energy to make it a fun ride, provided you approach it without expecting a masterpiece. set in an alternate 1990s, the story follows michelle played by millie bobby brown, a young orphan on a mission to find her missing brother. along the way, she teams up with keats chris pratt, a smuggler who may be just as lost as she is. their journey is set against a world filled with rogue robots, vivid neon lights, and a sense of postapocalyptic mystery. the performances of brown and pratt are easily the standout aspect of the film. brown, as usual, brings an emotional depth to her character that makes her relatable, even in a world that feels surreal. pratt, typically known for his comedic chops, delivers a solid, more grounded performance here. together, they have a dynamic that elevates the films slightly goofy plot. that said, the electric state is definitely not a film that takes itself too seriously, and thats part of its charm. its a bit of a rollercoaster some moments are genuinely exciting and emotional, while others can feel overthetop and ridiculous. if you go in with the mindset that its a fun, sometimes silly ride rather than expecting something profound, youll likely enjoy it. the movies action sequences can feel excessive, and its larger than life moments do veer into cheesy territory. but somehow, it works. at its heart, this is a movie thats built for spectacle, not necessarily for deep philosophical exploration. and thats perfectly fine, especially when youre in the mood for a light, visually striking experience. despite its flaws, i found it easy to get swept up in the films charm. if you approach it with lowered expectations, the electric state is a solid watch that delivers exactly what it promises a wild, futuristic adventure with a lot of heart, even if its not always polished. it might not be the best scifi film out there, but it definitely has enough going for it to make it worth a look. im rae serbeck, i watch and review all films large and small!",negative

"the creators of date movie bring us an actually decent spoof film the one and only epic movie.while certain things are stale and lame most of the spoofs and jokes are funny and therefore the good humor outweighs the bad humor making epic movie a pretty enjoyable experience.i think for the most part the acting is good very tv sitcom like which i find hilarious.they make fun of every hit movie in the book xmen,superman,pirates of the caribbean,narnia,harry potter etc. and for the most part they do a good job and create some funny spoofs.quite like date movie epic movie has a lot of random humor and seems to attempt at trying a family guy style and while that made date movie fail it makes epic movie pass because the jokes dont come out of nowhere and have a stupid punchline or no punchline at all the prime reason date movie sucked so badly.this is kind of like watching a sketch comedy series and although they have a thin main storyline that links things together for the most part youre wondering whats going to be spoofed next so you really dont care much about the actual characters.date movie also had a very sketch comedy feel but more of a low budget sketch comedy show like comedy inc or the underground lots of unfulfilled potentialwhereas epic movie has good quality spoofs and is more of a mad tv,saturday night live feel.date movie made spoofs to a lot of things that werent well known so to most the spoofs seemed like they made no sense but epic movie was smart and spoofed films almost everyone has seen therefore it is a lot funnier to people and they actually understand the jokes.is this as good as airplane!, space balls, or south park?certainly not but its not as bad as plump fiction or date movie its on the same fence as the scary movie franchise which i say is a huge step up from the directors last bomb date movie.overall i enjoyed the film its funny not overly hilarious but there are quite a few laughs enjoy it for what it is.",negative

"lets be honest youre seeing sonic the hedgehog 3 because youre either a fan of the gaming franchise or the two films that came before it. im a fan of the latter, although they are not perfect. i knew, didnt think, but knew that this third installment would beat them both, and i was right. beginning with keanu reeves, breathtaking is putting it mildly. his performance and the overall character of shadow the hedgehog, coming from a guy who has never played the games, was jawdropping. dr. robotnik and knuckles are great villains in the prior two installments. shadow surpasses them by having an origin story that, while familiar to veteran players of the games, is more tragic than any of the other characters in the franchise, sonic included. im a huge fan of reeves what more is there to say? even though shadow steals the show, the returning characters are still strong. sonic, tails, and knuckles are just as funny and charming as their appearances in the previous two entries, helped by ben schwartz, colleen oshaughnessey, and idris elbas energetic performances. what surprised me the most was how they put all three in a shocking internal conflict, one which i refuse to spoil in any fashion. you need to see it for yourself! i cant forget jim carrey as the two robotniks. first of all, he came out of potential retirement for this. this review is written by a tremendous carrey admirer, making it a big deal to me when they announced that he would reprise his role as dr. robotnik in this trilogycapper. of course, he recently said he returned because he needed the money, which is understandable, but this was no cashgrab role for carrey. he brings some nextlevel comedic energy when playing both ivo and gerald robotnik. every time hes in a movie, he always makes me, and millions more, smile and laugh, and here is no different. powerrest with pride and dignity, carrey. your work will continue to inspire generations to come. i want to take a break to discuss the experience instead of the movies contents. i saw it at a dolby fan event, my second time with the format since wicked. dolby enhanced both films for me, so be sure to see it that way. the theater i was in did something unexpected skipped coming attractions. amc usually allows audiences twenty minutes to go to the restroom or get popcorn by playing trailers for future releases, but not here. i feel bad for the people who came in late under the impression that it wouldnt start right when they arrived. additionally, i reserve that time to go to the restroom quickly. however, the film began immediately, and i only focused on the movie rather than anything else, a testament to how excited i was and how extraordinary the following presentation was. ill resume talking about the movie itself now. the action was some of the best ive seen all year. the other sonic films, admittedly, had incredible action, but this cranked the volume up to 11! if were only covering action, you bet its super fun! what else makes the movie remarkably powerful is its hilarious, the story outside of shadow is compelling, the cgi remains beautiful, and the people in my theater were freaking out at the mid and postcredit scenes. make sure to stay for that, sonic fan or not! if i were to give any seminegatives, the comedy simultaneously surpasses and is consistent with the other two films. its consistent in how its sometimes juvenile to its detriment. i also found krysten ritters director rockwell to be weak, but heres whats truly remarkable i dont care. in a year in which ive perhaps become more of a critic than a film fan despite my personal beliefs that i havent, i deserve and need to overlook the flaws because the rest of the film is unbelievably phenomenal! sonic the hedgehog 3 blew my mind, and i didnt expect it to. i went in with high expectations, yet still accepted the possibility that it cant be as wonderful as the hype warrants. i was wrong. technically, the voice acting and performances from the humans awkward way of saying it, apologies, the cgi, the wellused runtime, and the impactful narrative make the technical score a 910. said 9 is because of some issues relating to the screenplay. for the enjoyment score, i loved it! its easily the best of the trilogy and one of the years best films. im writing this before i watch the second film in the hopeful next barbenheimer postglicked sonic the hedgehog 3 and mufasa the lion king. mufasa has no chance! my problems with some dialogue and rockwell cant prevent the enjoyment score from being a 1010. the flaws are not enough to hurt the experience, and im happy i can ignore them. this experience is a mustwatch for any sonic fan and enjoyer of the preceding two films, and im thrilled to see what this franchise offers next!",positive

"at first i used to think its too long, definitely not worth it, id just be wasting my time, its probably lame .. let me just say its one of the best shows ive ever seen easily in my top 3. the characters are lovable especially the main character i love luffy and i do believe he is such a good main character that he out ranks the other mcs from animes ive watched. can he beat goku though? it does not matter how strong a character is but i am definitely not denying that luffy is indeed a strong character. the story is also good especially in the manga in my opinion the manga does better with pacing since toei hasnt always made pacing as quick as some are used to. but would you rather watch something that is short and has a feeling of it being unfinished or something where you can go on a journey, meet new people, and enjoy all the adventures the straw hats go on. this show is definitely worth the hype i used to be a hater a silent one of course but now im addicted and obsessed with everything. this story isnt just about luffy becoming the pirate king its about obtaining freedom, figuring out what the world is about, and doing it all with the people who are important to you. hopefully anyone who decides to watch this wont give up because of the animation in the beginning because i have no doubt youll find yourself appreciating being apart of this and even coming to love and miss the old style. yes it will feel slow at times partially because toei didnt want to catch up with the manga but it all will be worth it thank you oda for an amazing story that has years of entertainment and fun this story will always hold a place in my heart.",positive
"here is a film that you wonder how in the world that studio executives were duped into spending any money on this disaster of a film. what exactly were the people at sony pictures doing the day someone made the decision to fund this film? and then after the film was in the can did someone notice that it should be shelved or released for tv other than an expensive theatrical project? after sitting through the ordeal, i really cannot tell you much about the story. jon voight is a nazi type villain that goes around being foiled by these babies that speak in words that must be in some foreign language because i was not sure if it was english. the viewer is left unable to understand the script and unable to comprehend the plot. i can only guess that people thought looking at babies walking around in diapers, talking gibberish, would be sweet. however we learn that what the babies make in their diapers is exactly what this film is worth. absolutely one of the worse films made.",negative

i watched 30 episodes as everyone said this was the best comedy in history. after the second season i was pretty sure that this wasnt for me but the reviews were so good that i tried 2 seasons more. after 4 season i can say that this doesnt work for me at all. humor is pretty outdated. i guess it isint for everyone! but i can say that i really really tried! most of the time it feels like you are watching yhe same episode over and over again. after 4 season both of the main characters shows no growth and just do the same things and mistakes over and over and over again. there were some moments but they were too far apart for me to continue watching.,negative
"i dont care how good your animation is. i dont care how good your texture mapping is, or your pre rendered lighting, or your production design. unless any of it supports a well written story, its a glorified tech demo. and thats all this show is. its a bunch of short films mimicking things the filmmakers have seen before without any concrete understanding of why it worked in the first place. the shorts are made by visual effects artists, not writers. the focus and effort was clearly on the animation wow factor, and less delivering quality content, that people are paying for. i think the episode that finally broke the camels back for me was the episode in season 2 when the giant washes up on the beach it looked gorgeous the concept was completely original. then they have a terrible voice actor recite terrible, cliched, pretentious lines of dialogue that add nothing. everything the narrator says can be seen on screen. has this episode been dialogueless, it would have been near perfect. but these films werent made by story tellers, they were made by 3d effects artists. so none of them heard of the lesson they teach year one in film school show, dont tell. and on top of that, the dialogue is the most nonsensical lofty noise i have ever heard a pretentious british voice actor reciting lines he doesnt understand, but they threw in a bunch of smart words, so that means the writing is intelligent, right? really embarrassing. 210 because the animation is very good in all episodes, but none of the episodes themselves are good because the writing is poorer than poor. and im reviewing this as a show, not a tech demo. which is clearly is. 210.",positive
minecraft as a legacy in the gaming world has always left a big impact it is the worlds best selling game after all. but i think i can speak on behalf of everyone who saw the first trailer back in september that yeah this movie did not look very good with the trailers that have come. but now nearly seven months after the first trailers ive got to hand it to yall this movie aint as good as other game adaptations from movies but this movie genuinely was fun and i can tell there was a great passion from the team who all clearly love minecraft. but the story isnt really good and the pacing can feel weird somtimes but still something about this movie is so absurd and strange i couldnt help but laugh at some of the humor which im not suprised from the guy who made napoleon dynamite the film itself i would say is very good but there were some flaws but if you do like minecraft i would recommend it.,negative
"there is hollywood and there are the independents. the storyline is always the same, some vampire has to be killed. in underworld its the same, but that one contained a lot of cgi and had a lot of money. but the fact that cgi doesnt work makes it sometimes boring although it is a good movie. bloodrayne also has some real declined good actors. the storyline is as always the same but what makes this movie hateful or adorable is the amount of gore in it. and as i watched closely i noticed that olaf ittenbach was involved. the master of gore himself. some killings or slaughterings are not for the squeamish and thats the main reason that people are hating this flick. but if you love vampires and gore than your in for a good flick, i just cant believe that it has a 2,4 on the scale. that was also one of the reasons that i never watched it earlier but it was one of those days that you feel you have to give it a try. i was not disappointed. it has an open end, and there is now bloodrayne 2 available. lets hope the gore stays intact. its a one of his kind to see really good and well known ben kingsley, udo kier actors in this nice flick. so be it.",positive

"if you dont like what you see within the first 15 minutes of this film, turn it off or leave the theater, because thats what you will see repeated over and over again for the next three hours. okay, i get it. there are people who will do anything for money and who are morally bankrupt. this is hollywood meets soft porn when soft porn has already been killed off by oneclickaccessible porn. im not a puritan. this is just an objective fact. we live in the age of pornography. i, therefore, dont understand why scorsese thinks this is the shocking lens he should use to educate us on the evils of wall street greed and excess, unless he hopes to drag in the teenage boy audience, in which case, it simply amounts to pandering. in the end, i felt that it was scorsese himself who was morally bankrupt. i think it is time for him to reassess his career. no great film was ever made so by pandering to base instincts. great films stand on the strength of fundamental truths about human nature that leave the viewer leaving the theater uplifted, inspired, or awakened to elements of human nature in some way. this does not mean all movies have to have happy endings. the knowledge one takes from a good film can force one to reassess their values or ideas and this can be a difficult experience. but there is nothing fundamentally challenging about this film. even if you try to think of it as a sort of documentary, it falls flat. now, what about the acting? there is no doubt that leonardo dicaprio is a great actor. however, i havent been impressed by many of his recent efforts i.e. gatsby. in this film his character is one dimensional from beginning to end. there is no character development and no real opportunities for him to show his acting range. the same can be said for all the other actors, but given such an insipid script, what can you expect? after a couple of hours of watching scorsese trying to educate us on the evils of wealth, i just wanted the film to end. he seemed to have an ax to grind in the tradition of other axgrinders like michael moore and oliver stone. the last hour was simply an ordeal. scenes seemed randomly cut and pasted together. although i cant say there were not some interesting scenes within the film, they only served as sad reminders of scorseses wasted talent. it makes no sense at all to me why this film is rated so highly. maybe there are a number of people who were surprised to learn that excessive wealth can lead to bad behavior. all i learned is to be careful of giving too much credence to the ratings of any scorsese film.",positive
"a young lad has been hired as a security guard for an old studio. however, on his shift he unleashes a bunch of creatures from a vault and they start going after the young security guards friends. these creatures before killing their victims go into peoples minds to fulfil their wildest fantasies, causing all sorts of mayhem. hobgoblins is a movie thats selfaware that its bmovie entertainment. all the characters besides the protagonist are dumb stereotypical teenagers, however, the filmmakers go to the next level by having them in ridiculous and unrealistic situations. a scene that strikes me the most is a fight between the main boy and a guy whos just been out of army training. hes cocky and arrogant and he challenges the main boy to a fight, but this isnt no ordinary fight, its a fight with gardening rakes! they just bang the rakes together until the military guy decides to take a hit on the boy. the girls then cheer on the arrogant military dude and after want to have sex with him. its scenes like these that solidify the movies logic and well... its utterly hilarious! the creatures are very inspired by the gremlins in not only their design but the concept of them running amuck. there were plenty of gremlins rip offs in the eighties including the critters, ghoulies and munchies. however, hobgoblins has to take the prize for the most bizarre small creatures running amuck movie. if you watch this knowing about the ludicrous nature of this movie, then you will be in for a treat!",negative

"i saw this movie when i was a kid and remember it didnt quite make a good impression on me. there were many aspects of it that i remembered fondly its music, its look, the star quality of its main actors, and yet, it didnt move the ways other 70s movies did. it didnt have the shock and anguish of the the exorcist, a movie with plenty of humanity under its still impressive special effects. it didnt connect with me in the way the paper chase related to the subversive in all young people share. chinatown wrapped itself around its audience like a sad song, and cabaret chilled us with its disintegration of life as we know it. the sting was impressive but it was like that work behind the glass untouchable, and yet something worth admiring. i look back and cant help thinking how paper moon brought back an era, with its flaws, humanity, and spirit quite intact. what works the screenplay is rather dazzling, a labyrinthine construction of twists and turns, executed with almost clinical perfection. the players play others, get played, get bullied, and titter on the edge. it is like reading a book people recommend and never quite getting into it. sometime its dazzle prevents us from looking at its heart. both redford and newman are downright amazing, with terrific costumes and million dollar smiles. theyre both attractive and carry the film very well, especially newman who brings forth the qualities of wisdom and experience to the part. redford is competent and does a decent job, sometimes coasting on newmans powerful acting. years later, tom cruise would give one of its best performances in the color of money, once again trying to keep up with newmans expertise. in a minor role, gould shines as the team player who must adapt chameleon qualities to survive. brennan, durning, and walston fit in nicely. the score helps with the feeling of nostalgia for those who might have lived in the period. its simple and belongs to the classes the movie portrays there are no airs of culture, but a sassy quality, with plenty of attitude. what is a little problematic the film feels directed, cold, and uninvolving, keeps winking at us, telling us how good and clever it is. hills direction is never relaxed, but calculated and precise. directors are like painters, showing their personality in their work. less admired works, such as the drama in titanic might show less directorial expertise, but more human sentient, allowing its actors and audience to bond. earlier this year, another potential masterpiece was ruined by a filmmaker that has already proved himself quite capable of directing a safe bet of a film, keeping himself away from taking chances in cinderella man. much is to be learned from directors who take chances such as peter jackson in the three lotr efforts, films that could have collapsed by his choices to show exhilarating and extended scenes showing us the passion and energy he felt in the prose of the novels. his amazing displays of technical knowledge worked well because he wasnt afraid to take it further. his actors showed charisma and made us care, with the rest of the canvas finely structured to support the overall effect. chinatown still haunts us because its portrayal of the lower qualities in every human being were raw, uncompromising, part of the film noir atmosphere polanki tried to recreated. in the sting its photographic is at best pedestrian, and one cant help feel as if were watching a tv production, rather than a work of art. yes, the sting is a finely crafted work, but its heart is not big and strong as a matter of fact, it might be its weakest component, surrendering to the powerful brain that keeps trying to impress us. if you want to feel moved, refer to the other pieces of the 70s exploring the early 90s. there are much finer twists in chinatown, much heartfelt cons in paper moon and more clever displays of talent in bugsy malone.",positive

"the main reason why i watched this movie that is often described as one of the worst of all times is what appears to be daniel kublbocks tragic suicide that occured less than two weeks ago. the actor, businessman and musician jumped off a cruise ship into icy water and his body hasnt been recovered yet. daniel kublbock has always been a tragic character evoking both disgust and sympathy and who obviously had his share of mental struggles. his parents had wanted a daughter and separated in his early childhood. his mother was apparently an alcoholic who used to hit him sometimes while his relationship with his father was ambivalent. daniel kublbock auditioned for the first edition of a reality talent show when he was just seventeen years old. he wore androgynous clothes, appeared to be overtly emotional and had very dramatic, loud and unskilled vocals. daniel kublbock was looking for fame to find his own identity but refused to accept that he didnt have much talent and failed to understand that he was used by producers to have a clown in their show that people could make fun of. againt all odds, many female teenagers pitied him or even saw themselves in this sympathetically confused being and made his songs and records more popular than anyone would have predicted. daniel the wizard was released at the height of his career. instead of helping him find his fame and identity, the media attention had its share of negative impacts on him. daniel kublbock openly identified as bisexual, then admitted being homosexual and ended up claiming he was transgender shortly before his death. his physical appearance also shifted drastically as he looked quite androgynous as a teenager, then gave himself the look of a serious male businessman before adapting a feminine look with dresses and heavy makeup. his music also changed from anglophone pop rock music over latin pop to a mixture of blues and jazz. daniel kublbocks fate is tragic because he never found his true identity and his erratic behaviour gave him a few moments of glory but also a few moments of resentment. blaming those who bullied him because of his at times annoying behaviour is only partially accurate as his family, managers and friends should have helped him deal with his mental issues first instead of supporting him being watched by millions on television when he was still legally a child. ironically, much of this torn character can also be found in this movie that mixes fantasy elements and documentary aspects. daniel kublbock is seen going completely crazy on stage at one moment and sitting thoughtfully in an isolated room in the next scene. the film portrays a young female teenager who admires the unique and different singer while male teenagers despise him for his erratic behaviour. this film actually shows us who daniel kublbock really was and how he was really perceived by society. these two elements alone make the movie bearable and justify a slightly generous rating. the rest of this film is a catastrophe. the plot is beyond ridiculous. the acting performances are stiff. the camera work is shaky. the sound is unsteady. the movie mostly consists of concert footage weirdly intertwined with poorly scripted fantasy elements. while other bad movies such as the room show a certain degree of passion for filmmaking or are at least entertaining like samurai cop, daniel the wizard is neither passionate nor entertaining. despite its short length of only eightyone minutes, it feels incredibly stretched and could have been cut in half. the movie righteously sold very poorly but is today considered a cult flick because of its flaws. honestly, those flaws are so amateurish that they arent even worth discussing. daniel the wizard is only interesting to watch if you are intrigued by the lead actors tragic fate. if you come here expecting hilarious entertainment, you have to looke elsewhere. calling this film one of the worst ever made would be exaggerated. describing daniel the wizard as unsuccessful low budget mashup of random documentary elements and weird fantasy parts is more accurate. this movie is a sympathetic wreck. such seemed to be the life of its lead character as well. may daniel kublbock rest in peace.",negative

"the fable of helen of troy gets done within an indian fantasy world in this very long film. you have a movie that is heavy with cgi and green screen, and its not good cgi. the acting and the story is good, some great production design here, music is brilliant and as nearly always, good songs too, just not that many here though. plenty of action, and use of slow motion is overused, which drags the film on for three hours. a good load of editing is needed, to be sure. the motion capture is used quite a bit in this, too much really, and practical effects would of and should of been used here, so there is a lot of style with no substance, hence the problems. action is not as great as it should of been. entertaining as it is, its flawed and needed polish, but i did enjoy it. looking at the scores and reviews here, i can understand the disappointment, but i gave it a seven out of ten as its an different take of troy. but its not the epic that it pretends or wants to be. can say if its worth seeing, but it beats being bored at home. thats about as fair as i can say.",positive
"firstly, there is a sex scene in the middle of the film which ruins it. up until this scene, i was planning of loaning the dvd to my brothers and sisters who love the hunger game films. i cannot do this now. this is not a film to watch with family because of that scene. which is sad, because for the most part, this is a cleverly written parody with some great gags. it surpasses the last few scary movies and haunted house film which all got cinema releases and is the best of the straight to video releases ever made. however many of the jokes are topical and based on cultural references which means it wont work for too long. in five years time for example, most the references will be outdated and subsequently the film will not be as funny. scenes involving the expendables, avengers and pop stars will age quickly. i recognised a joke parodying the sherlock holmes films which not many others will get or understand. i applaud them for not telegraphing the reference and trusting their audience with knowing what it was parodying. but it is a gag that will be less understood the further we move away from its reference material release date. there is a minor reference to a gay relationship but it doesnt last long or dwell on it. a couple of deaths were rather gruesomely visual which may be a problem to some viewers. but my main issue was the sex scene as previously mentioned. it doesnt outstay its welcome at 80 minutes but still feels long enough to be happy with. i will happily watch it again and the writers did a great job in a genre often tarnished with toilet humour. other than the one scene, it had very little of that in it, and featured mainly higher quality jokes. i strongly recommend watching this film, especially if you like the hunger game films, or parodies in general. but it earns the 12 rating it got for a reason so know this going in. i hope the writers continue making films like this, and preferably original parody moves not based on cultural references also.",positive
"season one was such a delightful and refreshing surprise in todays day and age. i am hoping that there is going to become a saying to be ted lassod, i really hope that catches on. it would mean people took the lesson that there is another way to do things...a nice way. there were a lot of melancholy moments in season one, but they did not out number the number of times the character ted lasso put on a good face, said and did the right thing. his philosophy seems to be its not about winning or loosing but about being a good person both on and off the pitch, and he follows through with that throughout his whole life. names like wanker are hurled at ted and he doesnt just weather the storm, but sends them back some optimism and positivity...which he continues to do at every turn. slowly but surely he starts to win people over and i would say that more than pays for itself as those people start doing the right thing and effectively passing on the right behavior and positivity to others like a ripple effect. this is the story of a small time american football coach who gets hired to coach a premier football soccer team in england without any experience. ted throws himself into making his team in to better men, which he thinks will make them better players. what he does not know is that his boss is an angry and bitter woman who hired him because she is hoping to sabotage the team because that is the only thing that her exhusband cared about and she wants to hurt him. ted starts by bringing her biscuits...for what he calls their morning biscuits with the boss. he is relentless in his positivity and it is wonderful. ted is accompanied by his assistant coach, coach beard, who always seems to know just what ted needs...good or bad. and slowly ted starts to make friends...in his neighborhood, at the stadium, in the media, on the team...and eventually with his boss. wonderful cinematography. phenomenal acting. spectacular writing! i absolutely love this show and think it is just what we need to deal with these dark times. i highly recommend giving this show a try...i think it might warm the cockles of even the most cynical of hearts!",positive
"when i was 10 i saw the chinese live action version of dragon ball. it was an awful movie, it looked like if it had a budget of two thousand dollars or less. the acting was horrible and the special effects were pretty bad. it seemed like something that some fans would upload in youtube. the matter is that this movie had a budget of millions of dollars, and i still prefer the chinese version. the problem with this movie is not the history, the problem is that it lacks of the essence of db. i wouldnt be upset if just goku were more like a little innocent brave boy instead of a classic horny american teenager.",negative

"its been a weird day. my air conditioner went belly up and i sought refuge from the 100 degree heat at my local megamultiplex, buying a ticket to the bourne movie. after 20 minutes of that movies selfconscious unsteadycam filming technique i was feeling a little queasy and bailed. stopping at bratz to recover my equilibrium before seeking a refund and an airsickness bag. what i saw was a totally empty theater zero people just two weeks after the movies release. i couldnt find much similarity between the teen actresses and the dolls the dolls are all a lot cuter. what strikes me as interesting is not the content of the movie but the fact that it was given a wide theatrical release. the inventory of films must be pretty low if they have to send this anywhere but direct to video. as already pointed out this is the single most shallow, insignificant, poorlydirected, badly acted movie of this year, or maybe any year. it also has about the narrowest target audience possible for a mainstream film, 3 to 9 year old girls with an infatuation with clothes, shoes, hair, and makeup. they must be serious girlygirls, your soccer and softball playing daughters wont find anything to relate to here. but im not sure if the complaints about the message behind the film are really valid. it revolves around four multiethnic bff teen girls who have nothing in common except their fashion trend value systems. now this would be bad if the characters were played by beautiful young actresses in a school full of gorgeous likewise beautiful girls with perfect bodies. which is what you expect from the standard presold teen movie. but instead yasmin natalie ramos, jade janel parish, sasha logan browning, and chloe skyler shaye look ready to pledge a dogs, pigs, and elephants sorority. for a while i thought i was watching an episode of animal planet. meredith chelsea staub was a pleasant exception in this schools bovine to canine parade. they look more like four homely college freshman than hot high school fashion types and the student body looks just as bland. whatever happened to the days when starlets got parts based strictly on their beauty with their acting skills irrelevant? of course acting skills were just as irrelevant in these casting choices. which leads to the obvious question of how a group of people so average looking and so clueless about the thespian profession happened to all wonder onto the set of this movie looking dazed and confused. the point being that no little girl is going to get an inferiority complex or suffer from an eating disorder because of watching this movie. the producers have unintentionally managed the positive message that no amount of expensive clothes, shoes, hair, and make up can make an average girl look like a hot teen actress. speaking of wandering on to the set looking dazed and confused, jon voight plays merediths father and the school principal. now i realize that the highlight of voights recent career is a seinfeld cameo and his teeth marks on a pencil, but appearing in this mess is the equivalent of bela lugosi working with ed wood in the 1950s to support his drug habit. the movie concludes with a loud and irritating musical number which i suspect was inspired by the success of high school musical. then again, what do i know? im only a child.",negative

"this is probably the most reviewed title among those i really felt like writing about, but still i think it can go with yet another miniessay on how bad it was. being in a mood for something light and hearing theres something about a funny fat girl on tv i sat down to watch. for a reason unknown i thought about an original story about a fat girl who finds happiness or something like that. however, the fat girl was replaced with a thin girl, paired with a boy and a collection of unrelated idiotic scenes followed. the supposed meaning behind these unrelated scenes was a parody of scenes from all well known american date movies. the problem is that date movies are often referred to as romantic comedies and you really cant make a comedy being a parody of a comedy. funny turned into funnier results in retarded and romanticerotic element made into funny becomes gross. the crossreferences to popular date movies are possible to grasp only if you remember a particular scene from this or that comedy. there is no parody of the style or genre, but only situations and gestures are copied from scenes from other movies and put in a different context or more precisely, into noncontext. every scene seems more pointless and less funny than another. even if you are not a demanding viewer, in a mood for something silly, enjoying toilet humor and soft porn from time to time you may not be able to watch the whole of it. in my opinion to switch it off during a cats attempt at sexual activity with a dried human corpse is already a few scenes too far. the question remains when would you switch it off?",negative

"scorseses the wolf of wall street is based on the autobiography of jordan belfort, who, using loopholes in the law, created a multimilliondollar brokerage empire out of nothing, lived the american dream and ended up in prison. my name is jordan belfort. im a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in bayside, queens. the year i turned 26, as the head of my own brokerage firm, i made 49 million, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week. the film was flawlessly shot nominations for best film and directing and, although it lasts for three hours, it is not boring for a moment, and for the most part it is even very entertaining. leonardo dicaprio excelled in the lead role, but, as usual, remained only on the oscar nomination. he is supported by jonah hill also an oscar nominee, margot robbie, matthew mcconaughey, and many other notsofamous, but no less good actors. if you are looking for a dramatic but humorous portrayal of life on a high but shaky leg, a newly rich man who lives fast in crazy sex, drugs, and more drugs manner, you are in the right place. to gain some idea of the explicitness and decadence in the film, it is interesting to note that dicaprio once cited the tinto brass caligula 1979 as an inspiration and role model for making this movie. let me tell you something. theres no nobility in poverty. i have been a rich man and i have been a poor man. and i choose rich every time. because, at least as a rich man, when i have to face my problems, i show up in the back of the limo, wearing a 2000 suit and a 40,000 gold watch. but, although this story has some indication of social criticism and the potential for a deeper and more serious film, it still remains in the domain of a typical american blockbuster, without much substance and point. 7,510.",positive

"adipurush, a muchanticipated film starring prabhas, saif ali khan, and kriti sanon, fails to live up to the expectations of its viewers. despite a promising premise and a talented cast, the movie falls short in multiple aspects, leaving the audience unsatisfied and disillusioned. one of the major letdowns of adipurush lies in its character development. prabhas, known for his charismatic presence onscreen, fails to justify his role as the protagonist. his performance lacks depth and fails to evoke the necessary emotions that could have brought the character to life. similarly, saif ali khan and kriti sanon also struggle to make a lasting impact, as their characters feel underdeveloped and fail to leave a lasting impression. another glaring issue with adipurush is its screenplay and dialogue. the film relies heavily on overhyped and lowimpact dialogues that do not resonate with the audience. the lack of impactful writing makes it difficult for the viewers to connect with the story or the characters, leading to a sense of detachment throughout the movie. furthermore, the visual effects in adipurush, touted as one of its strengths, turn out to be lackluster. the cgi computergenerated imagery feels unpolished and fails to seamlessly blend with the liveaction sequences. the result is a jarring and unconvincing visual experience that takes away from the overall immersion in the film. the filmmakers had the opportunity to elevate adipurush by focusing on simplicity and utilizing a more accessible language. however, they missed the mark by overcomplicating the narrative and using convoluted storytelling techniques. as a result, the movie becomes unnecessarily convoluted and difficult to follow, leaving the audience feeling disconnected and perplexed. in conclusion, adipurush is a disappointing film that fails to capitalize on its potential. the lackluster character development, underwhelming performances, weak dialogue, and unimpressive visual effects contribute to its downfall. while it had the ingredients for success, the execution falls short, resulting in a wasted opportunity. ultimately, this movie fails to leave a lasting impact and will likely leave viewers feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.",negative

"this was a pretty good movie. granted it was a bit cheesy and hokey at times, but you have to realize that this movie isnt for 16 year olds looking for a lot of heated action. this movie was geared towards children. which is why the fight scenes are more cartoony. i liked the actors in it. the late jim varney did an excellent job of playing a goofy, yet overall, bad guy. i suggest you see this, that is off course if you are in the age group of 12 and under. i guarentee that your kids will love it.",negative
"if i had the choice between dying from a terminal case of kidney stones or seeing this movie again, i would die a happy man knowing that i had only seen this awful movie once. put simply, mortal kombatannihilation makes the american ninja movies look like bruce lee masterpieces. the action was laughably stupid the dialogue was utterly atrocious and the plot somehow managed to lack a beginning, a middle, and an end. did this movie even have an editor? well i guess you cant expect and probably shouldnt expect much from a movie based on a video game. i guess the only thing more ridiculous than making a movie based on a video game is making a movie based on a breakfast cereal. hmmm... i guess i wont be surprised to see lucky charms annihilation opening in cinemas soon... the makers of mka should be thankful to movies like night of the lepus, dusk till dawn, or the ernest goes somewhere or does something movies for without them this movie would easily be the worst piece of cinematic sputum of all time.",positive
"everywhere people look, there is someone staring at a machine. computers have become more popular than they were ten years ago. gameboys and ipods are constantly used by young people the world over. even mom and pop stores rely on machines. who predicted that all this was going to happen? one person did in 1936 and his name was charles chaplin. the worlds greatest director said all this in his best film modern times. obviously predicting the future wasnt chaplins only intention. he also wanted to take his beloved tramp character to bigger and more exciting settings. the gags are important for all of chaplins comedic pictures and modern times is no exception. finally, the tramp was given a real love interest and one who the viewers want chaplin to get together with. modern times stands as not only one of the funniest, but also one of the most important movies of alltime. one of the most famous images from modern times is one showing the tramp in the middle of a group of cogs. what most people dont know is what occurs after, which involves the tramp becoming crazy and being sent to a mental asylum. this represents something that was happening to factory workers at the time. chaplin understood the workers problems and was able to show what was happening to them on screen in a comedic, but respective manner. however, the main reason that modern times has become timeless is because it is still relevant in todays society. technology can be found everywhere nowadays, so much so that people are now obsessed with getting the newest game system or portable video device. chaplin feared that that would happen and he used his film to show the future decay of society. about a decade before the publication of george orwells 1984, modern times featured a factory president barking orders and spying at everyone using a television. what is even more impressive is that the television did not enter the world until the 1950s. now, while modern times is a silent film, people are heard speaking, but only from electronic devices showing chaplins opinion on the talkie revolution. however, since this would be the little tramps final appearance, it was time to give more space for more gags. charlie chaplins short films concerned mostly simple gags repeated throughout its short course. when he made the large leap to featurelength films, he allowed the tramp character to grow far from what he considered a comedy to be. he had said to mack sennett while leaving keystone films that all you need to make a comedy is a policeman, a park and a pretty girl. yes, modern times does have various policemen as well as a pretty girl, but it has moved far beyond the park. chaplins wonderful idea to lampoon henry fords assembly line involved him moving the tramp from the park into the factory. he also renamed him the factory worker. people are so enthralled by the factory workers actions due to how well constructed the story is. chaplins screenplay is so entertaining and thrilling. this is a story that makes one think and laugh at the same time. only the tramp could go through each job and fail miserably, but already be ready for a new adventure involving a new girl. in chaplins previous works, the tramp is mostly seen going after a girl and trying to win her heart. however, there is always an obstacle in the way, whether it be a big bully also fighting for her affection or blindness. in the end, he never does get the girl and walks off into the sunset. for modern times, the tramp and the gamin are a team ready for new adventures. with chaplin not trying to get together with her, it actually works out better for him. paulette goddards performance is very nuanced and she is a girl the audience likes and was probably the smartest female character in chaplins film. the tramp and the gamins combined knowledge of hardknocked life make them fight the oppression of the world. even when theyre down on their luck near the end of the film, the tramp gives this important piece of information buck up never say die. well get along! the tramp was always not only raising the viewers spirits, but the characters in his films as well. the gamin was the last character hed give his advice to and it was probably his best. anyone down on their luck should have a positive outlook on life, because it wont get better if someone mopes all day long. for those with negative minds will lead a horrible and unhappy life. these are the ideas that people should carry with them everyday. while one of charlie chaplins main intention was to make people laugh, he also wanted to educate viewers about the problems facing people in america. modern times is a masterpiece where the tramp fights depression, gets the girl and makes people have a jolly good time.",positive

"i was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the united states entered world war ii. on the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as nazi germany could be misconstrued as rash. but chaplins brilliance isnt limited to making a joke out of everything. in fact, the seriousness of his message wouldnt have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. drama alone wouldnt have had the bite and resonance that this film did. laughing at someone adenoid hynkel can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone the jewish barber can be the best way to love them. in the jewish barbers final speech, i forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. they are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. for this reason i believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.",positive

"the trailer was incredibly promising, compelling all of us to watch the movie at least once. i was expecting a lost in spacetype adventure, where mickey repeatedly dies for a meaningful cause and comes back to life to fulfill his purpose. however, the story didnt quite take that route. for those who usually claims a plot to be very much predictable, this movie is not like those. the first part of the film was quite good, filled with dark comedy. we witness mickeys suffering, understand why he chose his job, and see how indifferent everyone is to his recurring deaths. this tone persists through about twothirds of the movie. the expedition leaders were the most disappointing characters. they should have been more responsible and sensible, but the story chose to depict them as foolish jesters. the ending and climax was not very satisfying and was quite unpredictable, with numerous plot points, such as communication with the planets inhabitants, that felt chaotic. as for the acting, robert pattinson delivered an excellent performance, showcasing distinct personality shifts between his versions of mickey. the other actors also did a commendable job, but the story itself was the primary letdown. spoilers i am left with two major questions after watching the movie first how did the leader of the planets inhabitants know mickeys name? second how was mickey confident that detonating himself wouldnt also destroy the other mickey?",positive
"watching this was one of the most impactful and emotional experiences ive had with film in a long long while. watching the story of how different characters developed alongside their trauma differently was immensely powerful, only helped by the great direction and cinematography. i cried upwards of 6 times through the movie, sobbing really. it had visually distinctive style and action scenes, which honestly hit really hard. the twists and turns were both unexpected but not outoftheblue, and were very effective. whilst there were some things which called back to the games, i still enjoyed it even as not the biggest sonic fan.",positive

"birdemic shock and terror was released in 2010. i cannot believe its taken seven years for this film to finally popup on my movie radar. if youve never seen birdemic shock and terror, do yourself a favor dont wait as long as i did to catch it. its a movie that has be seen to be believed. words cannot do it justice. all at once, it is one of the worst movies ive ever seen, but one of the most fun. film classes should use birdemic shock and terror to demonstrate how not to make a movie. everything you think youve seen done poorly in a movie is most likely done worse here. its a nightmare. sound, lighting, cinematography, continuity, acting, and on and on are epically abysmal. its like watching a slowmotion trainwreck. the two best or worst, depending on how you look at it examples of what im talking about are the dialogue and special effects. the dialogue sounds so completely unnatural. no one talks like this. it sounds like someone took a foreign language script and ran it through an online translator. and the way the actors deliver these ridiculous lines with a straight face is truly priceless. as for the special effects . . . well, theres really no way to describe them. my vocabulary doesnt include adjectives that can possibly paint a mental picture to adequately describe whats onscreen. youll just have to watch it to see what i mean. racking my brain, the only positive i can come up with is whitney moore as the female lead, nathalie. she has more screen presence than the rest of the cast combined. as bad as birdemic shock and terror is, its still an absolute blast to watch. i cant remember ever having this much fun with a movie that is otherwise so gawd awful. i laughed so hard at the birds exploding on impact that i had to stop the movie more than once. as ive said ad nauseam, i watch movies for entertainment. and boy was i ever entertained. the first half is a bit slow or i would have rated birdemic shock and terror even higher. i feel good about my 710 rating.",negative

"by far, this is the most innovative of the whole series! i mean, come on! sea world! terror at sea world! you dont get any better than this, and i must say, the acting, the score, and the development, all written with intellect! i do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. with the same type of opening, of a p.o.v. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! the very idea of not one, but two sharks in sea world as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3d glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. alan parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. what most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and jaws 3d will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 910",negative
"yes hilton is in it, and thats probably all most people had to see before they decided to rate this movie. has any of you actually seen the movie, its about much more than just an ugly and a beautiful girl, its about finding someone special and looking beyond what they look like and seeing them for who they really are on the inside, and for most people doing that is a lot harder than they are willing to admit. the point the movie is trying to make is that to find the perfect person you need to look a lot deeper than their outside to really get to know then and sometimes the person you least expect might just surprise you the plot is simple yet entertaining the movie would however do a lot better especially in the ratings department if hilton was replaced by someone with a better reputation. christine lakin is great and for anyone who still remembers her from her start in step by step should see this movie. overall the movie is worth the time you spend watching it and it is definitely better that the current overall rating of 1.5",negative
"this is something that is often overlooked about this film. a couple of throwaway lines of dialogue between the future president and his friend after spotting cap strapped to a rocket indicate there may have been plans to start the mcu with this film, as two other marvel characters are directly namechecked. sadly, these plans were put on hold, due to this disaster that involved cap stealing cars by feigning carsickness, walking away from the car, then running back and driving off when the driver went to check he was okay. other than a few laughable moments like this however, this film is extremely dull. its worth watching if youre a diehard marvelcaptain america fan, or a lover of bad film, but otherwise dont bother.",negative

"people have criticised the 2003 remake of the texas chainsaw massacre as being a weak film compared to its ancestor. those who have defended it say, among other things, that compared to the return of the texas chainsaw massacre, it is a masterpiece. this argument is invalidated by the fact that compared to the return of the texas chainsaw massacre, ninetyfive minutes of anna paquin burping and farting in tune should be considered a masterpiece. in case i havent made it clear yet, my comments refer to the 1997 reissued cut. have you ever encountered a story, a film, or some other piece of art that is so utterly stupid it is brilliant? the return of the texas chainsaw is so stupid it becomes brilliant then painful within minutes of each other. a film critic once wrote that the lengthier a title is, the worse the film will often be. he also wrote that when a film changes title for a rerelease or international release, that is a bad sign. this film has had two titles, these being the return of the texas chainsaw and the texas chainsaw massacre the next generation. if the length of these two titles doesnt set off alarm bells, then the list of plot stupidities in this film will. i wont go into every idiotic point of this film. my personal favourite is the hick with a mechanicallyenhanced leg that can be controlled by remote. yes, you read that right. zellwegers character defeats him by stealing his remote and making his leg thrash about. yes, you read that right, too. one of the other victims is put up on a hook that goes through the back of her shoulder. mere hours in the continuity of the film pass by before she is found crawling on a dirt road. then a millionaire comes by, and it is revealed that this millionaire is paying the family to behave in this manner, for reasons that are not even given a pretense of explanation. mind you, those are just the standout examples of the films idiocy. what tobe hooper brought to the original tcm was apparently things like plot cohesion, or even characters doing things that make sense. the only reason to watch this cinematic abortion, put simply, is to see bigname stars at their lowest point. zellweger and mcconaughey, quite simply, must have agents whose farts smell like chanel no. 5, and whose urine tastes like champagne. james gale sums it up best this...all of this...its been an abomination. you really must accept my sincere apologies. it was supposed to be a spiritual experience. i cant tell you how disappointed i am. i think he was inserted as a proxy for kim henkel. if i had to give the return of the texas chainsaw massacre a score, it would be a big one out of ten. it excels alright, at failure. like howling new moon rising, it proves that no matter how low a franchise sinks, there is always somewhere lower it can go. people who thought friday the 13th part viii or freddys dead were rock bottom have absolutely no idea.",negative

"this show is the reminiscent of my childhood, as i grew up watching the 1991 version of the addams family and the 1998 tv series. even though, the series focuses on wednesday addams and her adolescent problems such as her fight not to be like her mother, love affairs etc. and her life among the other outcasts , it still has the feeling of the old show with all the interesting family members. to be honest, i wish we couldve seen a little bit more of the other family members but thats not a big deal as the series called wednesday. i want to underline another point before coming to the flawless performance by jenna ortega, which is the lack of representation of some outcast members. i havent understood the the purpose of other outcast members than enid, bianca, eugene and xavier. its understandable as nevermore is a huge school with many outcasts but i would like to see at least more of yoko as she seems to be written to be an important character but we could see not many scenes including her. hopefully, well see more from other outcasts next season. now lets come to the point of jennas performance which instantly increases my rating by one point. im not unfamiliar with her performance as ive watched her on the fallout, stuck in the middle, x and scream, but i was still shocked when i watched episode 1 of wednesday. ive watched lots of movies and series this year but her performance as wednesday has impressed me the most. its no shocker as she had given lots and lots of efforts to portray the character before the shooting started learning cello, fencing, archery and german. i dont even need to mention the dancing scene its pleasing to see she finally gets the attention shes already deserved from the fans and critics. i know itd be a long review as im unable to shorten my ideas as a nonnative speaker, so i added a pros cons section for ease to read cons lack of relationship with family members and representation of them. lack of representation of characters other than major characters and some minor ones. some cgi are a little bit cartoonish. script could be little bit darker and gory which would make the series more tim burtonesque as the shows rated 18 pros jenna ortega, shes just flawless, i couldnt think of any other cast for the role after christina riccis performance emma myers. shes so cool, funny and colorful. enid is perfect other half to complete wednesdays ying with her yang thing 3 christina ricci all other cast yes, including luis guzman as opposed to the most of the comments saying hes not the right choice, i loved his gomez and he looks like the gomez from comic strips directing is really solid, especially the first 4 episodes. p. s. i still wanna see an addams family story directed andor produced by tim burton, maybe after that he would give it a shot.",positive

"i first saw this movie as a kid, and i still love it today. the alien is so cute an adorable, and when it was sick it looked sick and when the alien family are all sick i was crying too. yes it had a lot of shameless plugs for coke, mcdonalds, skittles and wickes but it added to the story i thought. i was so relieved when the aliens got their coke and got better. the opening scene where they are on their home planet and a nasa probe lands is great, they get sucked up like in a hoover and then the scientists open the probe and find them. in reality it would have taken the probe a couple of years at least to reach earth and the aliens should have all starved to death by then from lack of fizzy drinks, but i can let that go. the acting was good i think. i looked at the child actors and none of them have been in anything much since mac and me. the wheelchair kid has not even had a little background role in a tv series or anything. i was interested to see where they were now. only tina caspary was listed and apparently she is with a travelling dance company. its not really that much like e.t. its more fun. the story is similar i guess kid from a divorced family meets alien. but the alien does not go home at the end but stays on earth. the song at the end makes cry a lot, as the alien family becomes a family of earth and everyone kisses each other. the speech bubble that says, well be back was a lie though! they never made a sequel! why not? oh how i wish they would. allt eh actors would be grown up now, but it would be an interesting film nonetheless i feel. i am aware that i am in the minority opinion about mac and me, but i cant help what i like.",negative
"nicolas cage and his horrendous movies. as for the movie overall, the christians continue to be bonkers that they want to frighten their followers with this ridiculous rapture notion which they invented about 150 years ago. oh the gullible, gullible lot. i watched this fantasy movie out of boredom, and it is truly stomach churning as expected. although the movie was made in 2014, thats 2014, not 1914, so jets do have auto pilot which is engaged in flight. just one in a long list of mistakes just to scare the christians. very bigoted also to show that christians were taken by the rapture, but muslims, who are also very religious, were not. christians or no one jerks to incite bigotry. typical christians thats inciting hate. just about every scene is geared around fear mongering. right down to their sky fairy taking a husband, but leaving his wife behind unprotected an elderly woman with dementia. a tiny baby taken from her mother all tactics to scare people into joining their religion. its appalling. christians are disgusting to play upon vulnerable minds. i dont believe in gods, but i do know that this type of nonsense is not in the original bible. all of this is bs that men came up with in the last 150 years to create fear.",negative

"so, if youre actually planning on watching this movie, you should be warned. its not very good. i mean, really not good. at all. its horrible. its worse than horrible. take the worst movie youve ever seen and multiply it by grahams number and youll be close to how horrible this movie is. when someone says about a mediocre movie, this is the worst movie ever! you know they havent seen this movie. anyone who has seen this movie would be much more likely to say, the movie i saw is pretty bad, but, its not as bad as troll 2. but its unfair to compare because troll 2 is like in a whole separate category. among the movies that are the worst of the worst, this ones not quite among the bottom dregs, which, to me, includes movies like manos, zaat, beast of yucca flats and pocket ninjas among those ive seen. movies that have no redeeming value. this movie sort of has redeeming values, which pushes it up barely to a 2 out of 10 in my book. so what are these redeeming values, you ask. well, theres the hammy overacting of the witch creedence, played by deborah reed. she doesnt appear to be trying to be funny, but her performance is so over the top, i comes across as comic gold. then theres some weirdly memorable scenes, like the one where the witch makes out with a guy with a corncob between her teeth and then the room starts filling up with popcorn. and who can forget the scene where the boy, joshua, pisses on everyones food to save them should i even try to explain this? and then theres the famous oh my god! line thats been popularized as one of the worst death scenes in film history. to explain all the things about this movie that went wrong would exceed the character limit of this review, by a lot a lot a lot. i wont even try. unless youre really into bad movies, you should stay away from this movie, far away. you shouldnt even watch a movie on a video player thats ever been use to play this movie. itd probably make even citizen kane suck by its residual suckitude. any video player thats been used to watch this movie should be subsequently burned and buried deep underground to prevent the infection from spreading. but if you are into bad movies and you love to laugh at them, this one is definitely worth laughing at.",positive

"as someone who grew up playing the game, i was both curious and a little skeptical going in. after watching it, i can say its... fine. its not bad, but its not great either. if i had to score it, id give it a 6 out of 10. its a decent kids movie with a some fun nods to the game, but overall, it doesnt do much to stand out. lets start with the positives. the movie is definitely entertaining, especially for a younger audience. kids will probably love the colorful visuals, silly characters, and fastpaced story. it captures the basic vibe of minecraft pretty well, with references that longtime players will recognizelike crafting tables, redstone contraptions, mobs, and even the nether. those little moments are probably what i enjoyed the most. visually, the animation looks solid. its not trying to be too realistic, which is a good thingit sticks to the blocky, and that consistency makes it feel authentic. the world looks alive and vibrant, full of the charm youd expect from the game. there are even a few set pieces that feel like actual playermade builds, which was a nice touch. but once you get past the references, the actual story is kind of... bland. it follows the classic heros journey formula, which is fine, but it doesnt bring anything new or clever to the table. the characters are pretty onenote, and while they have their funny moments, i never really felt attached to any of them. the emotional beats felt forced, like the movie was trying really hard to be meaningful but didnt quite earn it. the humor is mostly aimed at kids full of predictable punchlines. as an adult, i didnt find myself laughing much, but i could see how younger viewers might enjoy it more. it leans heavily into kidfriendly energy, which is fine for what it is, but it does limit the appeal for older fans. if there was an approach like jumanji it would have been better. so heres your headsup yes, there is a minecraft movie now, and no, its not terrible. but unless youre a big fan of the game or taking your kids to see something fun, youre probably not missing out on much. in the end, the minecraft movie works best as a fun little adventure for kids or diehard fans of the game. with such a massive and creative world to draw from, i cant help but feel like it couldve been more. more story, more emotion, more risk. i had better ways to spend those 90 minutesbut if you walk in with low expectations, you might enjoy it.",negative
"the show based on a uk sitcom of the same name is very funny and cleverly done. each of the actors plays their character well. definitely a fun, lighthearted comedy that gives some good laughs. yes. the uk version is excellent. but that doesnt mean that the us version is a bad show. if i hadnt watched the uk version, i would have thought the us version was hysterical and unique. generally, people do prefer the series they watch first. i loved the us version of the office and then tried to watch the uk version, but couldnt get into it. that said, the us version is different enough to make it enjoyable even for those of us whove seen the uk version. while a few of the ghosts are similar to the uk version, the us version has enough diversity in the characters and episode plots to make them interesting on their own. and as for those comparing the living married couples just stop. the us wife is optimistic and perky the uk wife more sarcastic and snarky. the us husband is adorable and a little nerdy the uk husband a bit of a clueless bluecollar guy. again stop comparing. enjoy it for what it is. finally do watch the british version. it is really funny.",positive
"breakfast club is one of the sweetest movies that i watched by ruling out the stereotypical fallacies. one can understand how parents latently and unwittingly force their kids to adopt their quirky behaviors in the past.some parents do regard the slightest mistake as being a loser. they are so perfectionist.some parents see their kids as retarded big mouth know it all asshole jerks. and others just ignore their own kids. others say win win win but do not care about feelings. well breakfast club is exactly such a movie into the innerworlds of such kids who are bullied by internal pressure. i liked the performance of emilio estevez but impressive performance of judd nelson is totally great!!! . the way he says the lines look, i can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kind of clothes. but face it, youre a neomaxizoomdweebie. what would you be doing if you werent out making yourself a better citizen? is totally cool i really liked it. of course the movie is not a faultless one. even if the performances and the message are quiet nice the movie itself is pretty stereotypical .allison renounces her maverick ways and succumbs to the mainstream female image makeup, pink dress, rather submissive, etc.. nerd, brian, ends the film without anyone, reaffirming similar mainstream conventions of male stereotypes as well, that a male who isnt either athletic or rebellious, and more so is intelligent and bookish, will be left behind and ignored by the opposite sex. i say a movie which has such a great message could have been ended with a more original ending.",positive

"carl and ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. they see newsreels of a daring adventurer named charles muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. he goes back to venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. nothing is heard from him in years. carl and ellie grow up and marry. they buy an old house and fix it up. the two save up their money to go to paradise falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. its present day and ellie has died. this is all told in a beautiful but heartwrenching montage that will make any human tear up. its one of the best montage ive ever seen. however, the film focuses of carl after the death of his wife. he is a recluse. after a problem has occurred, carl decides to go to venezuela, as a promise to ellie. however, hes stuck with an 8yearold wilderness explorer named russell. together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by pixar. saying that up is yet another masterpiece from pixar is getting clichd by now. at this point, pixar can do no wrong. what they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. up is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. compared to other animated films, up doesnt have innuendos for the older audiences. thats because it doesnt need to. this film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two pixar films. the rich story in up may might as well be the most realistic from pixar yet. its poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. the characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic well, except for the talking dogs, of course. the odd relationship between carl and russell grows as the film progresses. for the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. the film is also undeniably endearing. the film is so endearing, in fact, that youll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film. i didnt see this film in 3d but i can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. the whole look of the film is just wonderful. the colors are exuberant and lively. the animation is pitch perfect. the story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. the score by michael giacchino is sweet and lovely. the directing by both pete docter and bob peterson is really great. wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. the action sequences were impeccably crafted, ill admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one. overall, what i loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. the entire film just hits all of the right notes. with films being released these days, its fantastic to see movies like up are being released every once in awhile. i loved every minute of up and i assure you will too. its no surprise for me to say that up is the best film of this year but i find it hard another film may be better than it.",negative
"firstly a huge standing ovation for this masterpiece by kiran rao. made me so emotional and cry by the end of it. unlike the rigged reviews of bogus movies like tiger and fighter, this one is pure natural magic and deserves all the accolades coming its way. they have shown the reality of our times and woven human subtleties. so beautiful and truly heart touching. absolutely loved it. no nudity, no vulgar dialogues. no starry action. this is a proper family entertainer. aamir khan is always known for quality cinema and it is amazing how his wife also loves up the lofty standards set by her ex husband who happens to be the co producer. even without the usual bells and whistles, this movie is so engaging. those with a pure heart and joy for realism in cinema will love this gem. give this emotional story a family watch. you wont regret your decision. god bless the makers. too good. leaves a lasting impact on viewers, much after the ending.",positive

"i dont really disagree with the bad comments except that i dont think it was as bad as people are stating. the original is obviously a different movie because it was original, and even undertaking this movie was a difficult task. also, they tried to use jokes from the original to tie it in i guess i like it a lott but not even one of them worked. the things i did like were the original jokes with the other characters. i did laugh at the mascot guy, and some of the interactions between the characters were original. but again, my expectations were very, very low when i watched it and i also watched it at 4 am so i might be biased. but i know a horribly unoriginal movie when i see one and they definitely tried to add an original flair to this, which is funny at times. i would say its about 25 as engaging as the original.",negative
"this movie was a real treat. i say treat in the sense that it was one of the worst movies ive ever seen, hence i love it. the plot is ridiculous other posters have done a good job at pointing out the shortcomings so ill keep this brief. as someone alluded to previously after a secondary viewing last night reenforced, it is quite comical how the terrorists go through extreme measures to get into the park ie having a ship offshore, jet skis, scuba diving, underwater lasers etc, when they could just pay the nominal fee to gain access to the park! that was great. hulk hogan as always, is a crowd pleaser. i like at the end when he knocks off the tops of the underwater breathing apparatuses with a single blow they masquerade as oxygen diffusing projectiles! jim varney obviously was funny in his role as the antagonist, no doubt ashamed to be cast in such a lousy movie. and the three ninjas? dont even get me started. so cheesy with the ayais! over over. terrible actors, but it all adds to the ambiance of a wonderful film, albeit low budget misconstrued, unintentional comedy. would highly recommend, it goes without saying that a solid buzz while embarking on such a journey will no doubt add to the enjoyment derived from this little gem. cheers!",negative

"arguably charlies best film. maybe not his funniest but his best because theres so much more to it than the keystone kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly used. frankly i dont know how the guy did it, being so consistently humorous without using any words. all of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on chaplins genius for mime and situation construction. there are some words spoken on screen this was his last holdout against talking pictures but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another. there is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics. and the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium, a record player, a radio, a television set. charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country, after which he lived in switzerland. you couldnt tell he was a commie from this movie. it comments on its time, of course, the great depression, and charlie and paulette goddard are two poor people. management is shown as callus, playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line. there is even a communist demonstration. but its all played for laughs. one of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street. charlie picks up the flag and waves it, shouting after the truck. as he begins to hurry after the truck, still shouting and waving, a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and hes arrested. poor people steal, but they only steal food. if having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one american out of three was a communist, because thats roughly what the unemployment rate was. modern times is no more communistic than, say, my man godfrey or salt of the earth or the grapes of wrath. besides that, charlie is no classical marxist. marxism posited a transition from false consciousness the feeling that ones miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck to class consciousness the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault. charlie is no activist. he fumbles every job he gets. the other workers are hardly sympathetic. charlies not a working class hero but a black sheep. the opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and its hard to imagine that this was accidental. actually, charlie had lost a lot of respect in america because he had an eye for young girls. his second marriage resulted from a sixteenyearold girls faked pregnancy. paulette goddard, who became his third wife, maybe and maybe not, was twenty when this movie was made, and charlie was fortythree. in any case boy, if you want to get americans heated up just combine sex with politics. a surefire winner for the puritans. it may have cost goddard the part of scarlet ohara in gone with the wind because she may have been living in sin with charlie at the time. i dont want to spell out too many of the gags because i dont want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down charlies throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob. charlie looks as if hes strapped helplessly into his seat, but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself. the first time i saw this movie was in the arts theater on springfield avenue in irvington, new jersey. when paulette goddard first appeared, the man on my right chuckled and said, now thats a goodlooking babe. on my left, my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life. there can be no higher recommendation.",positive

"the wolf of wall street is infectiously entertaining. it is probably the funniest movie i have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. between all the fun however, there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power. acclaimed director martin scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this movie at a high at all times. never once does this movie lose its energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. there are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as if you are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more serious situations. the cast brings their a game. the stand out is obviously leonardo dicaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. this film really showcases his diverse range. overall the wolf of wall street is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum. its directed with a lot of flair and energy and has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of laughs. the cast is fantastic and dicaprio gives his best and most fun filled performance to date. i really enjoyed this movie and think its the funniest movie of the year 4.55",positive

"eight years have passed since disney brought us the second installment of moana and with this sequel we once again find the successful formula that won over viewers in 2016 and will do so again in 2024, thanks to the effective formula that led to its success. although in moana 2 we find new characters that add pleasant moments to the story, the construction formula remains the same, so the fun will be safe for the little ones and also for the older ones. however, that safety does not allow the story and this sequel to go a step further to try to innovate in new attractions, although it has a fresh and emotional story to its credit, it also suffers from a couple of gaps in the journey towards its outcome, which takes away from the intentions of a sequel that is charming in any case. the familiar characters continue to give us fun moments, moana is still a great disney character, and the studio continues to outdo itself with brutal, sensational and masterful animation, full of colors, textures and lights that visually make moana 2 a step further in subtlety. as for the music and its songs, perhaps it is quite lacking, but a couple of songs do their job, although not enough to stand out categorically. in short, it is a family adventure film full of excitement and visual wonders that focuses on the youngest members of the family. a nice message runs through its veins with a plot that is more complex and dark, but that has a current and pertinent message, which makes moana 2 a fulfilling and correct film that will leave the vast majority happy and others somewhat less motivated, but in no case offended or upset because the film has a formula that will leave everyone included because it is a proposal that will not offend anyone, rather it will involve everyone.",positive

"warning! major spoilers ahead! disaster movie is a marked improvement over seltzer and friedburgs date and epic movie. they pick and choose which movies to parody thoroughly, and which are simply twosecond cameos an example would be iron man, the title character of which is flattened into a tin canliterallyonly a few seconds after his arrival. their care and caution certainly pays off in a mostly hilarious film that satisfies those tired of the same summer blockbuster garbage or overrated indie arthouse junk. perhaps people do not like the selterfriedburg movies because they eschew subtlety altogether and tell rather than show why they are parodying a particular movie or celebrity. still, it was fun to see arthouse darling juno literally torn to shreds i did not see juno, but seltzerfriedburg let me know what the character of the original was like by mocking her dialogue by demonic muppet chipmunks. finally, seltzer and friedburg do good by killing off the sadistic villain from that overrated indie gorefest no country for old men. and whats not to like about a gratuitous girl fight between two very beautiful women, kim kardashian and carmen electra? in short the directors were judicious in what they chose to parody, the actors especially the versatile nicole parker did very well kim kardashian was not too terrible to watch as a firsttimer, and the carnivorous, devilish, cheaplooking chipmunk puppets kept me gasping for air with laughter. its far from the worst movie ever, and those courageous enough to brave the critics venom will find quite a treat.",negative

"so what can be said about the film that no one is talking about? you know what i am talking about! a remake youve seen hollywood poop out several times... a monster comedy about piranha fish eating up beach spring breakers. i could give you a movie summary and some spoilers but you wont care because i sure as hell didnt. i was so drunk that i honestly dont remember what i was looking at. me and rob bought the bud light platinum 12 pack and we had fun, unfortunately the fun stopped once the movie started. it actually was not that bad. haunting of the innocent holds onto that crown of dust. a bunch of somewhat famous actors accompanied the fish and double ds, christopher lloyd, david david hasselhoff, that chick that looked like emma watson, and the cowboy from anchorman. but they couldnt all save piranha dd. the laughs were few, corny jokes, and when you see a horror at the store with piranha fish on it you know you will have just as much fun watching it like dumping your money into a toilet and watching the money go down the tubes... mr. christopher floyd, you should have more respect for yourself and all the back to the future fans. after this one i could see crispin glover in his grace spinning around. 2 out of 10 stars. much like haunting of the innocent it was a dumb bore fest, without the platinum i wouldve been thrown into a boring rage.",negative
"do you ever find yourself watching a tv show and thinking, i wish that had been done differently.? do you ever find that a show which has great characters tends to be a spine, a cover and several hundred pages short of a good story? not cowboy bebop. something like this is hard to come by in any medium books, films, liveaction, comics, nothing ive seen has mixed such cool, wellwritten characters with rich character development and an intricate and complete story. harry potter is the only thing i can really think of, but even that let me down a bit in the final book ron remembered that parseltongue? not likely, jk.. this show also has a vast variety of episode styles. some episodes are childish and make you double up laughing while some are bleakly dark and adult, only the characters tell you it must be the same show. and this is the subtle way in which the story develops the characters by putting them in completely different situations each time, you learn more about the way they feel and react to things. the characters emotions feel so real you sometimes forget its animated. its difficult to pinpoint a real demographic for bebop because each episode is so different. while id say its an 11 in some episodes, others can be 15. but its not a kids show, and its not for mindless teenagers either. its a show you need to have a bit of empathy to really understand. the dialogue is witty and fresh, none of the love? thats why youre weak! ill kill you with one blow! bull you usually get in an anime series, its a million times more realistic than that. i personally prefer the english dub, the show seems imo more american than japanese so i think the american version works better, but both are good. in most things i find the finale can be slightly disappointing, it leaves you thinking well, ok, but.... part 1 of a twoparter is usually absolutely brilliant, building up and up and up to something, only to nosedive in part 2 because of some deus ex machina or untied plots or just not reaching the level you thought it would think heroes or doctor who even battlestar galactica let me down a little. cowboy bebop, however, did not disappoint. the story finishes perfectly. it could not have been better. if you like anime, you have to watch this right now. i cant believe it was 6 years before i finally got around to trying it out. if you dont like anime, you have to watch this right up until episode 5, just so you can honestly say you dont like anime. if you value wellwritten characters brilliant plot intelligence style and want a can of whoop ass thrown in, you should definitely give this a whirl.",positive
"ive finally gotten around to seeing this latest black christmas movie. first, its black christmas in name only. if youre looking for billy or phone calls from the moaner, you will be disappointed. i think you have to go into this knowing its its own movie and not part of bob clarks black christmas storyline. as stated in many reviews, it is pretty heavyhanded with its messaging. the messaging itself is fine and good. personally, i prefer subtlety over an inyourface approach. for instance, i love when actors can convey so much with a look and not require dialog to tell the audience what heshe is thinking. there is no doubt the filmmakers were going to make sure everyone understood the purpose of this film. even at the end of the movie when the explanation is given for whats going on, i would assume most audience members already had it figured out, so, again, we didnt need a drawnout explanation for the proceedings. all that said, i thought the first 70 minutes of the film were great. although predictable and heavyhanded with the message, i liked the lead characters and cared about them. i thought the actors did a great job, and the movie went along at a nice pace. all the scares have been seen multiple times before, so there wasnt anything scary in the action. the final 20 minutes, after the lead figures out whats going on, is a letdown. i understand its inclusion and drives home the point they are trying to make, but i thought it was a little too much, having me wonder if the filmmakers think im too dumb to figure this out. if they wanted something scary, i think they wouldve needed to keep everything at a human level. anyway, overall, i thought the film had a great beginning and progression, but the payoff was lacking with a message too inyourface where a little subtlety couldve made for a better viewing experience.",negative

"i got into this series around december 2005. i managed to see all the episodes during the summer. it took awhile to get all the dvds. and i would agree with those who knew the series longer than me. its very cool to watch. cowboy bebop takes place in the future, 2071 a.d. an alternate future when the economy and eco system went bad on earth and numerous populations of humans fled to live on mars, venus, or any of the moons that are close by the other planets. the story is about a bounty hunter name spike speilgel. who has had a dark past which he doesnt talk about to many people. his partner is jet black owner of the bebop starship. jet is an ex cop who quit the i.s.s.p. for his own reasons. hes also like a father figure to spike. together they travel around the solar system to find some wanted criminals who have bounties on them. with those bounties jet and spike are able to get money with no trouble at all. course they have to bring in the criminals alive, otherwise they wont get the reward money if the criminal is dead. throughout the series jet and spike will get team up with faye valentine a young woman whos past is a mystery to her, ein a data dog who is very smart, and ed a girl whos naive but a talented hacker. with all these characters part of the bebop team, they make one combination of teamwork, when they get along with each other. each episode is good in its own way. theres plenty of character development too when you watch the entire series. i like how the series was influence by lupin the 3rd. which is pretty cool to see something that looks like its lupin, but its incredibly different. those who want an anime thats serious and not childish, may enjoy this show. its very well animated, and since its taken place in mixed cultures, its very international. featuring characters of all races and culture. which i heard is why its successful in the usa. so those who havent seen the series, can check it out by borrowing the dvds from someone you know or buy volume 1 of the dvd to see for your own opinion on the series. its suggested for 13 and up due to it having language, violence, and some nudity.",positive
"i feel like i am at the receiving end of a cruel joke for having attentively watched this movie for 20 minutes before giving up. granted within that span of 20 minutes i had to stop three times just to take a breather. everybody phones in their performances if you call them that, with the exception of kristiana loken who probably didnt want to accept that this was a complete joke of a movie. actually i take that back, because jokes are funny, and the horror of this movie is no laughing matter. i think she was trying anyway, its hard to tell with such a bad actress. i cant comment on the story but im pretty sure there wasnt one. uwe boll was too busy counting his money from his german tax cuts to actually direct any portion of this movie. xena the warrior princess had better fight choreography than this. i feel dirty.",negative

"one of the most effective animes ive seen for a number of reasons. atmosphere, or moreso, the complete saturation of, being the foremost technique used in this series. the jazzy soundtrack sinks the viewer deeper into the ambiance of the characters world. the hightension action against these smooth and calm sounds adds to the impressive audiovisual dynamics here. the most effective element in bebop, like any good fiction, are welldeveloped and written characters. the protagonists here are bountyhunters, a precarious and uncertain vocation to be sure. they are after perhaps the most dangerous villains in the galaxy, and their own motivations remain clouded as well, leaving one to wonder just who to trust here. the highintensity action against the dreamy and smooth jazz is the most obvious creative dynamic, with the interestingly written characters on their many adventures fleshing out the rest of the series. so, the interesting characters, their complexity of moral guidance, and the amalgamation of action and calm are the chief elements of success this series has. favorite.",positive
"if, like me, you agree that the first two paddington films are amongst the greatest films ever made this will be both an enjoyable essential but also a disappointment. because its not about paddington adapting to living with a family in london or how a normal family adapts to living with a bear, it loses its original charm and certainly its humour. this is just another jungle adventure movie...but with a bear. it has a different feel about it more sentimental and noticeably not as funny. whereas the first two were hilarious to a decrepit old marx brothers fan like me, this one is definitely more of a family film clearly aimed at children. i could say we need more of the brown family and of their neighbours.....i could also say we need sally hawkins but whats the point. we had all that in the first two and since they were...dare i say, perfect, thered be no point trying to copy them. so yes, this is different, its horribly oversentimental at times and nothing like as funny but its still paddington. routine family fun rather than hilarious quirky cuteness.",positive

"a genial but instantly forgettable movie about the clashing belief systems of outgoing and incoming popes. that the film is forgettable is a bit of a surprise, since it was helmed by fernando meirelles, whose previous films, like city of god one of the best films of the 2000s and the constant gardener were certainly not forgettable. i suspect catholics andor those who simply care more about the politics of religion might find more to like about this movie than i did. i couldnt give a hoot about any of it, but i thought the film would have more universal appeal, and give us insights into what its like to be such a powerful leader. after all, i dont give a rats ass about the british royal family either, but i thought the queen was a fascinating character study. but the two popes isnt an especially insightful movie. its more like a gentle buddy movie about two old dudes who find that they have more in common than they thought. prickly questions, like how the outgoing pope justified to himself completely disregarding knowledge about sex abuse by priests, go mostly unexplored. jonathan pryce and especially anthony hopkins give very good performances, but this is middle brow entertainment doesnt have much reason for existing. grade b",negative

"first off, i have to say that dumb and dumber is one of my alltime favorite films. ive seen it countless times and its just as funny as it was the day i first saw it. that being said, i was delighted to hear that a prequel was going into development in late 2002. the fact that carrey and daniels were not returning was a bit upsetting at first, but the fact that it takes place in 1986 would just make them feel out of place and i was more than willing to give new actors a chance. after the official trailer, people bashed the flick relentlessly, vowing never to watch it because it looked like pure shit and nothing more. i, on the hand, couldnt wait until june 13th. i was there opening day, and i have to say this is, hands down, the funniest film ive seen in a long time. there were a few nods and references to the original, and derek richardson and eric olsen really perfected the parts of harry and lloyd. everyone seemed to love the bob saget cameo, myself included. funny, funny stuff. there were a couple of major problems, however. first of all, there are anachronistic errors littered throughout, the music being the most distracting. artists like vanilla ice and good charlotte certainly were not around in 86. another problem is the editing. test audiences werent big fans of this film, as it was trimmed down from 115 minutes to 82 minutes. luis guzman and mimi rogers had decentsized roles, but in the final product their presence was just about wasted. they even went as far as to delete a musical number and scenes from lloyds childhood i.e. how he eventually came to live with ray. but, despite being historically incorrect and having major editing issues, the film was still full of laughs and ends up being an enjoyable way to spend an hour and twenty minutes.",negative

"jack and jill should be pushed down the hill! this movie is terrible, thats the truth, which is sad because adam sandler used to be funny, with some great films such as happy gilmore and the wedding singer but this is just sad, an attempt from adam sandler to be funny once again but failing. the movie is about adam sandler playing two twins, one being a boy and one being a girl, watch the trailer, youll think that this is all some weird joke but believe me, there is nothing funny about it. the characters are unlikeable, the story is forgettable and overall it is just a waste of time! if you want to watch a good adam sandler film they do exist the wedding singer, happy gilmore or even 50 first dates but lately, i avoid any new adam sandler film like the plague, so please do yourself a favor and listen to this warning, avoid this movie.",negative

"the remake of the john carpenter film is hardly satisfying. while the john carpenter film was low on thrills, it sure had an interesting premise. the moody setting was pretty much intriguing and so were the characters. but this 2005 film has the thrills alright, thanks to the enhanced special effects and makeup, but it is low on substance. the characters are cardboardlike. the incredible premise seems too hackneyed. further the effort to make this spooky film almost shows throughout the film. tom welling and maggie grace are both okayish, and they sure would have done well in a better film. it is a lesson to all that remakes are a strict nono, unless they are made with the intent of making something better and more contemporary.",positive
"way too often when i ask people their favorite movies...one of these three flicks is offered.....spaceballs...shawshank redemption or monty python and the holy grail.ive always considered these movies over rated and thus avoided seeing them while simultaneously readjusting downward my opinion of the cinematic tastes of those recommending the flicks. i only avoided shawshank for a few months. ive got to admit it was pretty good when i finally saw it and if i would have waited a few more months it probably would have been better and if i had waited a few years it probably would have been great. i waited twenty years to see spaceballs and when it was finally forced upon me i watched it with an attempted open mind but kept comparing the flick unfavorably to other brooks films like blazing saddles, young frankenstein, high anxiety, silent movie,and the producers. i came away with the reinforced bias that mel lost his touch after silent movie. i held out for almost thirty years on monty python. then to my alarm my twelve year old daughter mary told me that monty python was the funniest movie she had ever seen. i like marys taste and when i told her that i had never seen holy grail, she was surprised and encouraged me to rent the dvd which i did. i played it last night and yup, i loved it. truly an original film. we laughed and now everybody is walking around going neeth etc. of the three grail is the best, redemption second and spaceballs a distant third. i wouldnt say i missed the boat..rather i waited three decades to catch it. now im on board...sort of",positive
before i watched this movie i said the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is the only movie i can give a 10 but i have seen this movie now and i cant describe it with words it has awesome animation even for its time awesome voice acting by the grinch and the narrator and the grinch in this movie is the best because in the jim carrey one is a bullied misunderstood creature and in the illumination one he is a likable guy wich is not a good thing for the grinch the music is great and it is the best dr seuss adaptation so i give it a 10 out of 10,positive

"although it had an 8.8 rating on imdb, i was very skeptical of suits at first. it looked like one of those shows where everyone is young, good looking, successful, and full of witty comebacks. you know, one of those shows that look kind of like, well, every other show out there. admittedly it was with a bit of surprise that i found myself enjoying the first season. it wasnt a masterpiece, but it was certainly an enjoyable show. i expected that after the solid first season that the show would only improve. instead, suits fell into a downward spiral. season 2 continued to play on season ones successes but also took its first steps towards becoming that just another contrived show full of good looking people making witty comebacks show. by season 3 logic seemed to go out the window as the show turned cheesy and downgraded central characters to buffoonery. the show was becoming something of a soap opera. the show came to revolve around who said what to who when, how they said it, and who is lying to who. characters became stuck in one dimension. plots seemed to repeat only with new characters all young, good looking and unbelievably successful, of course. cue season 4. in season 4 the downward spiral fell to new depths. the show no longer seems to be about the trials and tribulations of mike ross, but almost entirely about sappy romances, office gossip, and petty grudges. to be more blunt, the show has declined into a preteen drama. if you are a clingy 14year old girl who wants to gossip to your friends about what donna heard rachel say to mike about harvey it might be intriguing no offense to all the 14year old girls out there but compared to what the show used to be, it is a disaster. i find myself skipping entire scenes because they are simply annoying. what may be even sadder is that i spend a good chunk of the other scenes on my phone looking up things on google. i just dont care how about who is lying to who or about how long characters can keep their relationship a secret at work. its lame, and it isnt what made suits a good show when it started. all in all, there is no way that this show all seasons accounted for deserves an 8.8. not even close. really, watch other 8.8 shows like boardwalk empire, the shield, six feet under, homeland and dexter and then tell me that this show should be rated anywhere near them. season 1 may have been an 8 or so but honestly by season 4 the show has declined to a 3 or a 4.",positive

"its so refreshing nowadays to watch a trailer for a film and have no idea what its about, that was my experience with a simple favour. i became quite excited to see this film after the trailer and didnt want to know anything going in. as i was walking out of the cinema, i didnt really know what to think. paul feig, who is directing outside of his comedy wheelhouse, does a decent job here with the direction. the performances are great. blake lively gives the best performance ive probably seen from her as the mysterious emily, and anna kendrick is good as well as the cutesy, conservative stephanie. the costume design is good and the french soundtrack gives the film a interesting aesthetic. however, the film falls slightly flat for me when it comes to the script. the film chooses to focus a fair amount of screen time on a certain subplot relating to the past of anna kendricks character that doesnt really go anywhere or have an impact on the story. without spoiling anything, i felt that stephanies character arc suffers as a result of this thing. towards the end of the film, you begin to realise that there arent really any likeable characters and you dont especially know who to get behind. the plot meanders in a few places and as it unfolded it reminded me of a fair few movies i had seen before, such as wild things and hitchcocks rebecca. all that being the case, a simple favour can be enjoyable and you will most likely be entertained for its runtime. b 610",positive

"i dont tend to write reviews, but felt it necessary on this one. firstly, other than knowing 2 songs, i knew nothing about the story for cats. i soon realised, about 20 mins in, that there is no solid storyline, and perhaps it translates better on stage than the big screen. however, i loved it. the performances were amazing, i loved the dancing, and j hud was outstanding, i was sobbing by the end. its just one bizarre musical number after another. secondly, the cgi really isnt as awful as people are making it out to be. some bits looked a little off, but it wasnt distracting at all. in fact, at times, it was glorious to look at. the set designs were beautiful, and the way the actors moved was captivating. i can see why people may not like this movie, its definitely not to everyones taste, but its not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction. i think its the lack of story that makes it hard to follow.",negative

"at first a held certain reservations against watching a film with what appears to be a nobrainer title for a film about the very same beasts, but sometimes the direct option is the best. starring tom bartlett as kevin, a young and brave assistant security guard, and jeffrey culver as mccreedy, the wizened old security guard who has seen too much, hobgoblins takes us on a horrifying journey to the realm of the darker aspects of human consciousness made flesh. after a lengthy but suspenseful tour through the corridors of a mysterious storage facility, a group of frightening creatures known as hobgoblins are released from a wicked bank vault within the facility. these demonic beings posses the ability to take the lives of humans by making their innermost wishes come true, hover at human shoulder height at will, and drive golf carts. what follows is a twisted ride into the psyche, as a gang of hormoneladen teenagers witness the horror of the hobgoblins, and their own inner selves. writerdirectordirector of photographyeditorproducer rick sloane allows the audience no pause from the terror of the sickening creatures, and the atmosphere and execution is overall spot on. forgivably freudian, the movie posits that when the primitive urges of the id infect the aspirations of the superego, what wishes we hope to fulfill will inevitably doom the self, but through the use of rationality and technology, even the most misguided soul can be retrieved from apparent demise. unfortunately, the film is held back from inducing true insight in its audience due to some unfortunate use of prosthetic eyebrows on mr. culver. this distracting little mishap did cost the film one star in this review. in the end, hobgoblins left me with an optimistic view of humanity. for if we can successfully survive the onslaught of such abominations that attempt to let our darker selves consume us, what else is there that could truly destroy us? i found the title ultimately an impeccable choice, since as we all know hobgoblins are more introspective than regular goblins. 10 stars.",negative

"of course, of course some like it hot is arguably the greatest screwball comedy in the history of hollywood. but, as they say, the devil is in the details. one of those details casting could have instantly derailed this classic. who to dress up in drag with tony curtis, run from the mob led by george raft and hook up with marilyn monroe at her most sensuous? oh, and to field a marriage proposal from joe e. brown despite a, uh, gender issue? and by the way, what actor to play over the top without taking his own brilliance too seriously and ruining the whole shebang for everybody? on the 25th anniversary of the film, i acted as hostinterviewer of an evening with billy wilder and i.a.l. diamond and got a rare peek behind the scenes and an upclose look at both wilder and jack lemmon, the actor who met the aforementioned requirements perfectly. i hope you find the following story amusing. among other things, it illustrates that, no matter how high the budget and how big the stars, film is still an art form and chemistry matters, and that chemistry is very often predicated on serendipity and just plain luck. in hollywood, they say its not what you know, but who you know. they might have added, its also who you know if you run into each other at a serendipitous time. i acted as hostinterviewer for an evening with billy wilder and i.a.l. diamond on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of some like it hot. great stories. wilder lived up to his reputation as one of hollywoods great wits and raconteurs. a dervish behind thick cokebottle glasses chomping on an everpresent cigar stub, he was at once elegant and raw, a man who had fled the nazis, pulled himself up by the bootstraps through talent and guile, and beaten hollywood at its own game. jack lemmon was just a nice guy. really. the quintessential hollywood everyman, even nicer and more accommodating offscreen than on, which was saying a bunch. he and wilder would have one of the industrys great collaborative friendships. but not just yet. and this is how it started. lemmon told me he did not know wilder well when, as luck would have it, he happened to be dining with his future wife, felicia farr, at delmonicos restaurant one early sunday evening at the same time as wilder. the great director spied him and dropped by his table later on the way out. wilder, as was his way, came right to the point. gunna do dis story where youd dress up in drag and run avay vit a girls band after seeing the st. valentines day massacre vonna do it? he asked the startled actor and who played startled better than lemmon?. recalled lemmon while sitting in his office his oscar for 1972s save the tiger gleaming on a shelf behind him in that one sentence, i had the whole story. for the first time, i took a role without having seen the script. and we all know the result. oh well, nobodys perfect.",positive

"according to imdb, the intouchables set all sorts of box office recordsthe second most successful french film in history in france as well as the number one film for 2012 in germany. so, because of this very impressive pedigree i was perhaps expecting a little more. now this is not to say its a bad filmits wonderful. it just didnt seem quite that wonderful. but it is well worth seeing. as for the plot, this movie is a truelife account of a quadriplegic man franois cluzet in search of a new aide. however, all the folks who apply for the job seem the sameboring and sterile. on an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesnt seem interested in the job at all omar sy. and, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract. while the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. the acting particularly by sy is just terrific. but even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. it takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with classincluding some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks i have ever heard. it is a lovely film.",positive
"virginia cherrill charmingly plays a young, blind, flower seller whom the tramp charlie chaplin falls for, hook line and sinker. later that night, he is crossing a bridge when he encounters a suicidal, dipso, millionaire harry myers whom he convinces to hang about for a while longer, and who by way of appreciation invites him to a party at his mansion, then to a series of evening entertainments. thing is, when he wakes up with the mother of all hangovers next morning, though, he has never a clue who the tramp is and so gets his butler to send him packing. meantime, still determined to help his new love, our kindly vagrant reads in a newspaper that there might be might be a cure for her blindness but it will be expensive. his boozy buddy offers him 1,000 to help but when, as usual in the morning, he sobers up and denies all knowledge of the gift. the police are called and things now take a series of unhappy turns that force the tramp to think of other ways of raising the cash. this challenge is especially spurned on when he discovers that she has left her usual selling spot and is now quite poorly and being taken care of by her grandmother florence lee and they are facing eviction. its probably his attempts at boxing that provide for most of the entertainment here, but there are plenty of other humorous exploits especially between him and myers and the scenes with cherrill are touching and joyous, too. chaplin keeps the pace moving along well with plenty of variety in a film thats a gem to watch.",positive

"the first thing that comes to mind after rereading the caption of the film, it that the teens are anything but. its worse than the 90210 stars trying to say theyre still teens and attempt to play the old bopper roles. another thing that struck me as odd is the genre is titled horror. whose idea was this? i think weird al must have directed this movie or perhaps the director from the scary movie series. i say this sincerely as it seems someone was playing a farce with the movie and making a mockery of other films in the process. from the simple plot of zombies and teen sex quite redundant today to overactive camera shots emulating that of the matrix, this movie aims at outrageousness. but maybe for some it is right up their alley and the director delivered the goods. that is, of course, if you are looking for some lowbudget wannabe horrorfilm that presents idiot heroes, topless women, overnight rambos, and a quick concocted old curse or some other explanation for the terror. i think this is todays version of something like attack of the giant spider, except of course that probably had much better acting. oh, and as a addedbonus, dont be surprised to see bizarre dubins from the video game. just more backward comedy if you ask me.",negative

"visually, this film is the perfect candidate for several nominations for the golden raspberry or antioscar awards, although it may be attractive, the reality is that it has too many points against it. from my humble opinion, this director should not make movies again and he should continue directing commercials and advertising whose works are more impeccable than this one. jeepers creepers reborn is packed to the brim with very bad digital effects, if we learned anything from the third film it is that it is a franchise where computer generated effects detract from the quality of the film instead of adding to it, well that is something that jeepers creepers reborn returns to to confirm. the performances are lousy, im even surprised that dee wallace lately lends his talent to mediocre productions like this one. the entire cast has flaws except for jarreau benjamin who could be a good creeper and replacement for jonathan breck but poor production affected the vision of his character. there are story points that are unoriginal and make no sense, the movie is very incoherent and makes its predecessor jeepers creepers 3 look like an enjoyable movie. i give a big shout out to the entire makeup and prop making team who really did a good job but the direction taken by timo vuorensuela makes their work sadly unattractive in the film. mr. vuorensuela i wish you could answer my questions. was there a need to make a cemetery in cgi? was there a need to make the walls of the rooms cgi? was there a need for so much cgi? he both boasted and described on his blog that the movie was shot on location in london and usa but it really doesnt look like that. i give it the minimum rating because unfortunately there is no 0.",negative

"laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semioblivion, i happened to catch this movie on cable. i wouldnt want anyone to think that i paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or heaven forfend! that i watched it straight. having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of the house, battling chariot type 27, the hanged man type 041, and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen. it doesnt. the banal plot revolves around a group of crazy kids a la scooby doo attending a remote island for a worldshaking rave whatever that is. you kids today with your hulahoops and your miniskirts and your pat boone after bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric, they find the rave deserted. passing mention is made of a house presumably the titular house of the dead but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence. a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a party?! is that it? oh, so this rave thingy is just a party? in the grand tradition of reeuphemizing used cars as preowned, or shell shock as posttraumatic stress disorder, the word party is now too square for you drugaddled, siliconeimplanted, metrosexual jagoffs? it is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. intelligent thought stops here i dont think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie reanimation. zombies cant die theyre already undead. they do not bleed, they know no pain. unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. at least, thats what my jamaican witch priestess tells me. which means that a .45 shot into their hearts is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth gouts of blood. at least in the video games logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot reanimate itself. yet each actorslashmodel gets their matrixcircularcamera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from return of the jedi, who get knocked out when ewoks trip them. i suppose the films writer, mark altman, having penned the nottooshabby free enterprise, felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference, in the character of jurgen prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dungswill. there is also a reference to prochnows primo role in the magnificent das boot, when one of the untrained bactors mentions that he looks like a uboat captain. . i wonder how many of this movies target audience of squareeyed swine picked up on any of the snide references to other films, as when prochnow declares, say hello to my little friend, presaging his machine gun moment. aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the videogame concept i.e. the game ends when you die you cannot win, this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white people. a better use for this films scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school, although ona grauers left breast did a good job, as did her right breast and those slomo running scenes priceless! i especially liked the final scene with ona trying to act like shes been stabbed, but looking like shes just eaten ice cream too fast. attempting to do something more constructive with my time, i pulled out my digitallyrestored, 35th anniversary, special edition, widescreen anamorphic dvd of manos the hands of fate. ah, yes! the drugs were suitably brainnumbing now here was some quality filmmaking movie maniacs, visit www.poffysmoviemania.com",negative
"let me just say that i was very skeptical about this show. judging from the sneak peaks and previews, i assumed this was going to be just another family guy brikleberry lazily animated show with some cheap and low standards. well gee wizz, i was very very wrong! rick and morty might seem like some stupid knock off of back to the future or some money laundering scheme as part of late night cable tv, but its not. behind all the jokes, each episode surprisingly has a strong message and whether you can relate to it or not, you wont really feel like the end of each episode was a bummer. the weakest aspect is the animation. its not pretty and seems out dated. despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. no, not even one bit. the absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon. unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable. they arent just there as fillers and they are nearly as important as the main story. in fact, in most episodes its hard to tell which one is the sub plot and which one is the main plot. what im trying to say is that this show is near perfect. what are you still doing watching new simpsons and family guy, go watch this show if you havent already. its a great example of how tv hasnt turned to total crap.",positive

"cowboy bebop is by far the best anime series ive ever had the pleasure and privilege of experiencing. this is not a kids show, by any means. finally, a real anime feature that doesnt involve something dealing with putrid childrens themes and overly flagrant characters. cowboy bebop is none of these. it has its share of comical scenes, but it seamlessly integrates them into a web of other predominant emotions drama, action, thriller, suspense... cowboy bebop is the epitome of cool and intelligent anime. an art i thought had long since been forgotten. you will enjoy the witty dialog as well as the action scenes, dramatic sequences, and most of all the incredible musical integration jazz and other cultural music that allows for an incredibly open palette of emotions as you view the action on the screen. expect the unexpected. the voices they chose to play the dubbed, english version of the original series couldnt have been planned better. it strays from the stereotypical highpitched whiney and otherwise annoying voices that usually plague a good anime port. not this one. the roles are taken seriously and were performed very well. this series is definitely speaking to an older audience, something rare in porteddubbed anime series these days. i am grateful for having the opportunity to experience this wonderful masterpiece. cowboy bebop is, by definition, art.",negative
"i never would have guessed i would ever see jennifer lawrence in a role like this. when the trailer for no hard feelings first came out, i expected it to either be a great comedy because she chose it or just simply a paycheck movie that was unfunny. well, its actually neither in my opinion. its a very predictable comedy, but the humour is very good, and i laughed quite often. if youre up for some good laughs with no baggage, i recommend no hard feelings and heres why. about to lose her mothers home, maddie barker jennifer lawrence decides to follow an ad for a money opportunity. the task is to date percy becker andrew barth feldman, a couples 19 yearoldson who is socially awkward and desperately needs to come out of his shell before he starts college. maddie does everything she can to seduce him, but a real friendship begins to form, giving the film a little more depth. their relationship is what holds this film together, so its great that these two played off of each other so well. ive said that i never expected lawrence to take on a role quite like this one and what she does here with what shes given is great, but the standout here is easily feldman. ive never seen him perform in anything before but i will not hesitate to say that i cant wait to see what he does next. his chemistry with jennifer lawrence worked really well and he actually has some good acting chops. his quirky performance had me laughing pretty hard the bar scene in particular and he dialled it back for a few effective dramatic moments when necessary. i didnt expect to come out of this film loving an actor i hadnt heard of before, but well done. no hard feelings is the type of film that doesnt take any risks in terms of storytelling, but it tells its cliched story very well and i was smiling throughout. yes, i predicted every single plot point which definitely took away from the film for me, but it didnt hurt my enjoyment while watching. with some very funny moments and a few dramatic heartstringtugging moments in the third act, i had a good time with this one and i think many others will too. its not a great film by any means, but i say check it out. no hard feelings is now playing in theatres.",positive

"the movie is already half a century old but it has kept its charm which makes it worthy of being considered a classic. this is one of the early romantic comedies. but besides fun moments there is also a lot of drama and a pretty original idea for the story. no wonder it won so many oscars in 1960! on the first glance it may seem like the ah so boring good guy vs bad boy story and the female that finally gets a clue, but it is more than that. we have baxter who lends his apartment for influential coworkers to climb the corporate ladder and we have fran, the elevator girl, who has an affair with the boss while he promises to get a divorce. there is a parallel in their stories as they both agree to be mistreated by people with more power hoping for a better life and not seeing yet that even when they get it, it wont be as happy. a smart story is brought to us by a great cast. jack lemmon and shirley maclaine are easy to identify with and they show some great acting skills with a lot of face expressions and gestures that perfectly show us the feelings of the character. i especially like shirley maclaine, she has some spark in her and so much freshness that take over the screen. she wasnt a big star yet when she made the movie but then she deservingly became one. supporting cast was great as well. jack kruschen as dr. dreyfuss was great. a good movie with a good story, great cats and well presented atmosphere of its times.",positive

"its got to take a lot of cheese for dc comics to discreetly distance itself from one of its if not main then certainly most iconic characters. it took michelle pfeiffers equally iconic portrayal of the selina kylecat woman character in tim burtons excellent batman returns to bring the idea of a cat woman film to the forefront. what might have sound like an appealing proposition back in 1992 somehow didnt feel as relevant more than a decade later. and for good reason... the shy patience phillips stumbles upon the dirty secrets of her employer and gets killed for it. not to worry though since shes brought back to life by some catdeity of some kind and is reborn as the ballsy catwoman so she can get an hair do, go shopping, do a bit of clubbing and incidentally find out who killed her and why... oh and then she meets some generically good looking cop along the way... vengeance and impossible love story ensues. the end. no, i mean it the end. everything about catwoman smells like left overs, the remains of a sunday dinner stretched into a monday casserole, exhausted from having been tried and done so many times before and bloated out of all proportions with stupidity and pointlessness so the script would be slightly thicker than a rspca leaflet. it would be very difficult to single out one particularly bad aspect of catwoman from another as they are effectively interwoven into a complete disaster. this is such a formulaic hollywood product that everything about its story or lack of thereof mired with plot holes the size of australia is already known to whoever has ever watched a film before. worse of all, it is so stereotypically marketed even through its soundtrack that all that was missing was halle berry snapping her fingers while saying to sharon stone huh huh! no you dont girlfriend!. the performances of its cast is made of sheer noncommitment, an acute disaffection that is both understandable judging by the overall btise of the piece and insulting considering that people had to pay to see it. last but certainly not least, the faux gloss of its cgi effects and the posturing of most of its camera works all conspire to hide the general lack of depth but actually manage to raise the bar of ugliness to brand new heights. so much so that it would be difficult to believe that it was all accidental. it boggles the mind to think that halle berry could have ever thought catwoman to be a good career move. witnessing her, dressed for the oldest profession, struggling to act through this aimless debacle, the word trapped springs to mind. was this some contractual obligations? what is certain here is that artistic integrity took a back seat after enough zeros were laid down on a cheque.",positive

"how can netflix spend 300 million on this? seriously. thats an astronomical budget, and yet, electric states fails to deliver anything remotely fresh or engaging. the entire movie is a parade of wasted potential, a formulaic attempt at nostalgiadriven scifi that never manages to carve out its own identity. the story is painfully predictable, devoid of any real tension, and lacking the kind of twists that could have made it stand out. from the very first act, it feels like you already know exactly where its goingbeat by beat. theres no sense of discovery, no depth to the emotional core, and certainly no stakes that feel meaningful. its as if the script was written by an ai trained on every blockbuster from the past decade but without any human soul to make it resonate. and lets talk about the casting. what exactly was the vision here? are we watching a guardians of the galaxy spinoff mixed with ready player one? because if thats what you want, just go watch those movies instead. they do it better. this film borrows so heavily from existing franchises that it never establishes its own footing. it tries to be quirky but lands somewhere between forced and awkward. some performances feel out of place, others seem like theyre from a completely different movie. the characters are either too flat or too overthetop, leaving you indifferent to their journey. then theres the visual spectacleyes, it looks expensive, but what good is that if the worldbuilding lacks depth? the cgi is polished, sure, but it feels hollow. a beautiful but lifeless landscape, much like the movie itself. a 300m budget should buy more than just visual effects it should bring an experience, a connection, a story that stays with you. instead, electric states gives us a soulless, generic blockbuster that evaporates from memory the moment the credits roll. it had the potential to be something truly gripping. instead, its a waste of anticipation and time.",positive

im honestly not a big fan of the first three jeepers creepers movies but as mediocre as they are theyre still enjoyment to be found in them. after watching this new one however it makes those first three look like peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy. its a horror movie that fails in almost every aspect to craft on screen. the story is the most cliched meandering thing that could be put out. the characters are dull and uninteresting with even some more stereotypical than a joke book. the kills are the most generic uninventive you could ever think up. the creeper himself while i never thought was ever anything special has now been downgraded both personality and makeup wise to a cookie cutter overpowered lame slasher. not to mention they tried throwing in this sadistic cult that worships him and its never explored further. i was also pretty baffled at just how this movie is not ashamed in showing its ugliness. theres a great deal of very phoney green screen that almost made me believe this movie was made by full moon pictures. its obvious this movie wanted to go big but if you cant do it just dont bother. the only little bit of amusement i got from this movie was some costumes and set pieces at a halloween party. i know the first three films director victor salva is a sick monster. but at least you can say he was a competent filmmaker with solid ideas. the makers of this film supposedly want to do a trilogy but after how this turned out i dont see it happening. with all the horror movie villains getting fresh comebacks lately it doesnt seem like the creeper will be rising back anytime soon after this atrocity.,negative

"loved the show. didnt care much for uncle fester as he seemed like an unnecessary distraction. there were a few moments where her attitude felt tedious but overall, a perfect rendition of the wit, ability and fearlessness of the wednesday addams character. jenna ortega did a masterful job as the stoic young woman where slight nuances of facial expression were subtle but expressive moments of character development. i enjoyed all the performances and the story line was engaging enough. i remember watching the original addams family tv show and this in depth story on wednesday was a worthy rendition of those characters and a lot of fun to watch.",positive
"hey! lets take that really crappy movie starring kirk cameronwho just sucks, by the wayand make it even worse! the first lines of dialogue made me want to turn this movie off. yes! the writing is that bad! the religious messages are not subtle in the slightest! every performance feels incredibly phony. you hate every one of the characters, and you would hate them even if the movie didnt condemn them from the beginning because theyre all stupid, annoying people. how did the guy get a gun aboard a plane? the special effects work is embarrassing. when the main character is up on the bridge you can see the clouds through her head. so much objectively wrong with this movie. i dont have the energy or passion to point everything out.",negative

"son of the mask is a comedy film directed by lawrence guterman. the film stars jamie kennedy, alan cumming, traylor howard, kal penn, steven wright, late bob hoskins and ryan and liam falconer as tims baby alvey. the film was a stand alone remake of the 1994 film. a cartoonist faces a dilemma when his dog chances upon the mask of loki. after conceiving an infant son by the magical powers of the mask, he understands just how difficult child raising can be. there are certain films which leaves so great impression on the viewers that remaking the film or making the sequel of the film is always a tedious task and one needs some great story or some great creativity to either recreate or make sequel but alas in the case of this film we neither has any great story or great creativity and has some terrible plot and messy execution. the plot of the film is stale and cliched and the execution is terrible, the film shouldve never been made in the first place. the film lacks almost everything. the film has some bad vfx, pathetic acting, humorless jokes and pale climax. i didnt found any reason to advise you to watch this film for me it was a complete waste of time.",negative

"i was curious to see this one since long time because i had the memory that it was the worst of the series by far. watching it again i was surprised a little bit. because i think it wasnt much worse than part 6. maybe even an inch better beause there was more plot and the jokes were a little bit more amusing. i also liked the ending with lassard, it had a little bit of that old glory that should be in the series finale. the russian setting doesnt work really well for me, its a little bit forced or something. its interesting that christopher lee was in this film. ive never seen him in a comedy. but he didnt give much value to the movie because he didnt do anything but talk few lines with russian accent. alongside with part 6 this is the weakest police academy movie. not one of the worst films ever, but only recommended for police academy maniacs.",negative

"wow, this movie was even worse than my expectations. the editor must have add, because the cutting was so fast it was almost subliminal. both the editor and director have absolutely no idea how to cut an action sequence all closeups without even the illusion that halle was actually working that day. and the cg was not up to the task. dumb story, dialogue sounding like it was written by a seventh grader, bad directing, bad editing, bad acting, awful and inappropriate music, and a ridiculous catwoman mask. its completely unwatchable. even halle berrys beautiful face, sexy body and round booty would not justify a five minute look. pitof thinks hes a director, but this movie proves hes not even a competent visual effects director. its a crime that any studio would blow 100m on a pseudo director when this country is chockfull of actual directors who could have taken that same budget and made 40 good movies.",negative
"the only way i can psychologically process the experience of watching this film is to assume it is an intentional comedy designed to subversively mock the superhero genre. otherwise, i would have to rank it as one of the worst movies i have ever seen. superman iii was an unmitigated disaster but still had some decent moments. its successor, however, is completely and utterly irredeemable. the storyline is recycled and lethargic, and you can feel the lack of interest from the cast. even at just 90 minutes long, the film is painfully slowmoving and feels like its never going to end. the coup de grace of superman iv is the introduction of nuclear man, who is, by some distance, the single worst villain i have ever seen in a movie. i simply dont have words to describe how awful this character is. mark pillow is either a comic genius or literally the worst actor of alltime. christopher reeve is a wonderful actor and one of my personal heroes. his book still me is one of the most powerful things i have ever read and i have given copies to almost everyone i know. it pains me deeply to award one of his films the dreaded 110 but i have no choice. this movie is truly horrific and a blight on the reputation of everyone involved.",negative
"frieren beyond journeys end is a rare gem in the anime landscape, offering a contemplative and emotionally resonant experience that lingers long after the credits roll. its a journey that prioritizes character development and quiet moments over bombastic action, creating a world that feels both vast and intimately personal. the story follows frieren, an elven mage, as she embarks on a new journey after the end of her partys decadelong quest to defeat the demon king. what sets this anime apart is its exploration of time, memory, and the bittersweet nature of mortality. frierens long lifespan provides a unique perspective on the fleeting nature of human existence, allowing viewers to reflect on the importance of cherishing every moment. the characters are beautifully realized, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. frierens stoic demeanor gradually gives way to a deeper understanding of human emotions, while her companions, fern and stark, bring warmth and humor to the journey. the interactions between the characters feel genuine and heartfelt, creating a strong emotional connection with the audience. the animation is stunning, capturing the beauty and tranquility of the world with breathtaking detail. the backgrounds are lush and vibrant, creating a sense of immersion that enhances the emotional impact of the story. the soundtrack is equally impressive, with gentle melodies that perfectly complement the animes contemplative tone. frieren beyond journeys end is a masterclass in slowburn storytelling, rewarding viewers who appreciate nuance and emotional depth. its a journey that will make you laugh, cry, and reflect on the beauty of lifes fleeting moments. if youre looking for an anime that will stay with you long after youve finished watching, look no further than frieren beyond journeys end.",positive
"i note that most of these reviews so far have been from people who enjoyed the original toy story movies when kids, and who are now adults. for that group i completely agree that this is a great movie. it has grown along with them, and offers a deeper, darker and more emotional story. as an adult, i loved it. for exactly the same reasons though, as a father of young children i was a bit disappointed. my 5 year old son has watched the first two toy story movies countless times, and adores the characters. they are as relevant to him now as they were to others when they first came out. that being said, its clear that toy story 3 was not made for him. first of all, its scary. not haw haw scary, but really scary. be prepared to comfort a young child often. secondly, a lot of the humour will go over a kids head. it still has some great moments, but fewer than the first two films. theres a fairly long scene that involves subtitles, so kids who cant read yet are out of luck. thirdly, its long. at almost two hours there will likely be at least one bathroom break required. i would say the overriding emotion is pathos. its basically a farewell to much loved characters, but young kids who have just discovered them recently may not be ready to say farewell. so its a great movie, but possibly a misleading one for parents with young children. its not as innocent as the first two, and may leave your kids more sad than happy. its still worth taking your kids to, but maybe budget some ice cream for afterwards.",positive

this movie continues to get unjustly attacked because of mostly sexist reasons. and the truth is that despite its slay girls marketing campaign the film is perfectly serviceable genre movie. in fact very few things actually separate it from its group. basically a group of sorority girls is targeted by a fraternity with insidious intentions. its really nothing new especially if youve seen the tv show buffy the vampire slayer which this actually feels like an extended episode of. and i say that with admiration because thats my favorite show. as the film goes on the woke gets to be a touch too much towards the finale but it is entertaining and the points that are made in this genre themed battle of the sexes is really quite intriguing. the kills happen mostly off screen and because the killers are quite menacing some pay off gore would have been appreciated with an r rating. that being said i appreciated all the clever bits to the exorcist 3 homage to the rakes on mistletoe and women rougeing their cheeks. it all leads up to a girl power finale thats cheer worthy. in the end its a refreshing take on expected material that deserves way more of the right attention than its been getting. budget 5m domestic box office 10m worldwide box office 19m 3.755,positive

"gee whiz, what a flick! its so stupid its almost funny. almost. but not really. mostly its pretty dull, but still somehow quite watchable. the music is fantastically awful in its eightiesness. who better to play captain america than matt salinger? yes, you read that right. the matt salinger. what? youve never heard of him? me neither, and considering his performance in this movie, its no wonder. serious mindfck occurs at the very start of the movie. the blue, red and white title captain america unceremoniously appears on the screen but were in 1936 italy! some italian dialogue makes me wonder if i have accidentally gotten hold of a dubbed copy, but my fears are thankfully never confirmed although i doubt that the italian dubbing mafia couldve done a worse job at characterization than the american cast. anyway, we see a little italian dude playing the piano. some anonymous military bad guy smashes a window and sends his henchmen to blow italian dudes parents to pieces. it takes a while before we understand what the hell this has to do with anything no, its not a scene from the godfather which was accidentally spliced into the film during production because we quickly cut to seven years later as an afterthought 1943 world war ii is running full throttle and dazedlooking steve is mugging his way through a tearful farewell to his family and girlfriend, bernie and here i was thinking this was a guys name!. we are treated to such wonderful dialogue as its just that... i love you and i cant stand thinking that i wont know where you are or what youre doing! sparks fly, chemistrys high or maybe its the scriptwriter and steve leaves his old neighbourhood... never to return... or will he? it turns out steve signed up for some lab rat work for the accentually challenged military. before he can say no paycheck is worth this!, hes strapped to a chair, attacked by flashing colours, and captain america is born. theres no time for celebration, however, because an evil nazi bastard shows up and starts peppering everyone with a prop. what i love about this scene is that the military is carrying out this secret, important experiment in the basement of a bar and its free for anyone to just drop in! oh, that and the flashy colours, of course. captain america is hit and we find out that hes immune to bullets. the accentually challenged military guy sends him to stop red skull the italian dude from the beginning of the movie a bad guy with a really awful case of acne who thinks the concept of jokes about english lessons is the best thing since spaghetti bolognese. steve arrives at the bad guys hideout, some bland action occurs and captain america shows that hes a complete loser by actually letting this walking advertisement for clearasil get the better of him. suddenly strapped to a nuclear missile, steve grabs hold of acne mans wrist and the latter makes the only sensible thing he uses a knife to slice off... his own hand. thats truly brilliant thinking there, buddy. then we cut to a poor child actor telling his mum that hes going to be president of the usa when he grows up foreshadowing!. the kid goes outside for some reason and sees steve america and the nuclear missile in the sky. this is so inspirational to him that he has to rave about it to his blondehaired snob of a friend, who touches his shoulder in a very disturbing way. id just like to point out that this is the worst child actor ive ever seen, ever! and ive seen the omen 2006, santa claus conquers the martians, and stephen kings version of the shining. 50 or so years pass and voila! poor child actor 1 has indeed become president of the united states. a lot of boring stuff happens as steve america is carved out of a block of really authenticlooking ice in alaska meets bernie whos now supposedly 66 i must say she ages extremely well!, married and has a seriously hot daughter and has to cope with the cultural changes of the us since 1943, sort of like in austin powers only less touching. we also find out that acne man has magically transformed into incompetent plastic surgery man whom i will refer to as ipsm from here on. some filler scenes, filmed as an excuse for the cast and crew to go to italy, ensue until we finally get to the climactic showdown between ipsm and steve america. now steve finds himself in a situation where he has to stop ipsm from blowing up europe !, but cant because... i.p.s.m. is armed with a machine gun?? what the hell? i thought he was immune to gunfire? whatever. my brain hurts now. i wouldnt want to spoil the films ending for you so ill just leave this already too long plot summary now. add to what ive just said porn movie actors, a very eighties soundtrack, overly ambitious action with none of the budget it needs to not be a complete joke, and matt salingers... um... original performance as the captain himself, and you have a film which is actually pretty watchable in an fmovie kind of way. in conclusion its exactly stupid and unintentionally silly enough to keep your attention to the bitter end unlike something like bloodrayne, whose stupidity bored me to tears and really all you could ask for from a good bad movie. its pretty mean to call it one of the 100 worst movies ever. remind me never to write a review this long again. my next stop is also an early nineties cheesefest, this time about vegetablelovin freaks troll 2. pray for my sanity.",negative

"jason friedberg aaron seltzer. im generally a defender of the mainstream, but these two....these two.... they embody all thats wrong with hollywood, hell, with modern film in general. i hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films, they arent satirizing films they are referencing films, they are not a mockery of crappy hollywood excess, they are an example of it. its like if michael bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive cgi and explosions. to do a parody or satire, you must provide or impersonate examples of your topic and mock them over specific flaws and contradictions, you dont copy them and change things by adding hiphop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. its clear they havent even watched the films that are parodied here, in fact, several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting, thus making effective parodies of those films impossible, and imagine for a moment if hancock or the dark knight were never made and they still included references to those films, would you still consider that hip and relevant?. and even if, pray tell, these films were funny, they are still offtopic. 99 of all the jokes have nothing to do with disaster movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. fact you cannot parody something effectively if you dont even mention it. cut out the offtopic scenes from disaster movie for example, and youll only be left with 3, maybe 5 at the most, minutes of film, mostly credits. i dont care if its the funniest film in the world, if it doesnt in some way deliver what it promises, im still not even gonna give it one star. if the titles were meant to be symbolic or somethinglike how dancing with wolves isnt literally about dancing with wolves and chris wares jimmy corrigan the smartest kid on earth comic is about an adult with autism, it wouldnt matter, but in this case, they specifically say what they are going to do, and then disappoint. and sure a lot of comedies have offtopic jokes, but not ones that take up 98.9 of the whole film! at least biodome actually took place in a biodome! so i apologize if you get off on being disappointed, sorry, but im not. i prefer to laugh when watching a comedy, or at least, have fun. and even worse, when they do make actual parodies of something, they only do lame, obvious, predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively, if not more so. oh, so hannah montannas a merchandising whore, wow i didnt know that!!! its like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parents are discussing politics by making political jokes, but who knows nothing about how politics work, so he just says im a politician and makes fart noises with his mouth. is that cuttingedge and insightful satire? no. but these idiots seem to think it is, because its basically what they do, only with actors doing it for them. my review for caltiki is a better example of satire. and dont call me a snob, because im a guy who loves stupid comedy, jingle all the way and the stupids are some of my favorite guilty pleasures, hell, i started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because i dared question the audacity of mystery science theatre 3000 and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks south park is a sign of the coming apocalypse. so dont blame other peoples films, these are crap all on their own. and if they intend their films to be that way, that just makes it even worse, so they intend to make offtopic, unfunny, parodydevoid, boring, unpleasant films? that just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. even assassination attempts. and if they really do consider their films to be real parodies, then they are onetrick ponies, and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few tricks,like the angry video game nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars, or dane cook being juvenile and unoriginal, although yeah, he is then these two are the one trickiest one trick ponies who ever lived, and their only trick is being offtopic. these films arent even entertaining in a so bad its good way, in fact, they are the antithesis of entertainment. i usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film, as i used to think that that was impossible and although ive done so, it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired, drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. well, its true, these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. in fact, if someone could have filmed me watching this garbage, im sure there would have been zs floating over my head. ditch this crap, please. oh, and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this, ill let you know i didnt pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film. the previous review will suffice for your freidbergseltzer film of choice",negative

"i watched this movie fully aware of how bad it could be. after all, its based on a video game that i played half of and got bored with. i was in no way even close to prepared for how bad this movie would be. the acting was some of the worst ive ever seen. the directing was pathetic. the story was unbelievable. in short, theres nothing that was good about this film. dont get me wrong i love action movies with horrible plots. i can tolerate mediocre acting if its fun. this movie wasnt. the jokes were bad, the accents were bad, the fight scenes were bad, the very premise of the movie was bad, the plot development was bad. dont waste your time youd be far better off expanding your horizons and checking out some foreign language action movies excepting, of course, french ones, because they dont know how to fight!. if youre looking to make the next mst3k movie, this is it.",negative
decent disney film that is fine for the whole family but lacks the heart and style of the other pixar films that came before it. the voice acting by all involved is great and the animation is as clear and precise as ever but it lacks a lot of what the first two toy stories had and lacks the heart that made those movies such landmarks in the first place. its a good movie but it really not as good as some people made it out to be.,positive

"when i uttered the words, baby geniuses 2 to man in the box office at the movie theaters i had a certain sense of shame and embarrassment. the only reason i went was because we had a group of about 15 film majors that thought it would be funny to all go see the latenight showing of this movie. we were right! from the second we saw the flashback to 1962 berlin, germany we knew this was going to be sooooo ridiculous that there wouldnt be any problem finding stuff to laugh at. the dialogue and the concept of this movie are so prepostorous that i contemplated dropping my major in film once it was over because i thought that if this movie could make it to the big screen, then hollywood is truly dead. i understand, this is suppose to be a kids movie. doesnt work as that even! there was actually a few young children in the theater and they were crying after about 15 min. into it. theres too many special effects and loud fight scenes to make it enjoyable for a child. plus, even a baby can probably tell how much crap this is. one of the funniest moments was during a part where theyre pulling a minivan into the head babys secret lair behind the hollywood sign...i know, thats enough to be funny....but if you look in the upper left hand corner in the screen you can clearly see a crew member just messing around behind a bush. thats how poor quality this is. well, thats all im going to waste my time saying about this movie. if you have a group of friends who want to just laugh theyre butts off for 2 hours way toooo long, then be brave and go see baby geniuses 2, itll be an experience you unfortunately will never forget.",negative
"seriously, dont waste your time with this. i was really driven by other users comment and its high rate, so i gave it a try. i couldnt watch the first episode till the end, as its just too bad to be seen. the actors are amateurs, the humor is so bad it makes anyone sad and the overall quality of everything is below standards. you have all the typical characters from humor directed to the elderly, trying to make you laugh with isolated nonsense situations, without any success. the all concept reminds me of an indie movie, but with no interest at all and i do love some alternative movies and tv series. about the story, its a good idea for a tv series, and it could have been a success, with the right production and actors that is. well, consider yourself warned!",positive
"i am going to write a certainly unpopular opinion i was bored watching this. you certainly wonder now how this is possible with all these great ratings? well, let me try to explain i felt it was a pinch of pulp fiction with each character having an origin story which lead to the finale. we had a grain of reservoir dogs with the madeup names. there was a drop of kill bill with the asian background, the revenge theme for certains, the yakuza and the fights. but there were quite a few other influences, too. for example smoking aces and shootem up for their crazy nonsense action. still i thought it was boring. hollywood these days is so out of ideas and uninspired and many writers think of themselves at the same level as for example chrichton, clancy .... or tolkien wink wink, nudge nuge, say no more yet it becomes obvious they lack the same talent. here the dialogues were supposed to be funny, but hollywood is churning out one remakerebootupdatemodernized versioncloneplagiarism etc at a ludicrous pace that the customer thats us is getting fat, uninterested, bored, underwhelmed and it takes much more to get the praise these movie companies think they automatically deserve. consume and root for our product ... until our next product. sorry, this movie lacked for me everything the aforementioned movies have, so no, this wasnt for me the blockbuster so many people make it out to be. and no problem at all if you enjoyed it",positive

the first mortal kombat movie was a pretty decent movie that was fun to watch had some great fight scenes and did a great job turning a simple tournament fighting game into a movie adaptation for the big screen. mortal kombat annihlation was released two years after the 1995 original and had a different writer and director also given a low budget and only given a short time to shoot edit and produce the movie what we get is actually an okay movie nothing special unique or award winning but still a fun and action packed movie that has a great soundtrack actual martial arts stunts and fight choreography and a big cast of characters both good guys and bad the actors from the original also return for the sequel although one is killed in the opening scenes so minus one johnny cage. a lot of the complaints about this movie were mainly about how over the top and cheesy the acting and dialogue is in the movie along with some bad costumes and special effects the movie got a bad reaction from audiences and critics and is often quoted as one of the worst video game movies ever made but in all honesty despite its flaws this is a fun movie to watch and doesnt take itself to seriously you will laugh at how bad some parts are but if you grew up in the 80s and early 90s when mortal kombat was just a two dimension fighting game with cool looking characters you appreciate the fun and often over the top aspects of the movie having your favourite characters jumping into fights in bright coloured outfits and tights fighting to the not so bloody end while awesome music plays. i recommend watching this movie if you enjoy fun action movies that dont take themselves too seriously and are just an hour and half of crazy fights overacting and cheesyness.,negative
"though i am not a big fan of computer animation,i have to give the folks at pixar credit.this brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.the attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.its obvious that the people at pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.highly recommended for any home library.",positive

"film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia. old films have become journeys to the past ways to visit times and people that no longer are. since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works, it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation. we look on the old to find what elements should make up the new. in city lights, and other silent works of film, a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere. while watching the film, i was impressed that chaplin really did love the story, the sets, the crew the whole project. while this may not have been the complete reality, it felt that way, and thus made the film more enjoyable. in silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response. since film is at its very core a visual medium, i find silent films to be the basic form of the medium. i dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense, but i compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early european art, before the concept of perspective was developed in the renaissance. many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in these works of art were not technologically advanced, but they were, and are, beautiful. the same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in national geographic. there is a warmth found in city lights, and other chaplin films the kid, modern times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today. maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty, and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer.",positive

"as this film opens a man on a new york subway platform sees an ethereal girl playing on the tracks he climbs down to help her but suddenly she isnt there. a train approaches but despite not being struck he dies with a look of terror on his face and blood coming from his eyes. detective mike reilly is given the case and, because it is feared a virus may have caused the victims bleeding, he is helped by terry huston from the department of health. inevitably there are more victims each found bleeding in a similar way. together mike and terry work to discover a link between the victims... the only connection appears to be that they died forty eight hours after visiting a strangely disturbing website that depicts torture and death. mike is also loathe to give up on a serial killer case that has been taken over by the fbi it involves a killer known as the doctor who tortures his victims until the beg to die. while i dont think this film is as bad as many reviews suggest i certainly wouldnt claim is its particularly good. the plot is a bit of a mess combining fears of dangers on the internet, the supernatural and a serial killer. there are plenty of plot holes although i wont list them to avoid spoilers. it isnt particularly scary but does have some disturbing moments. the cast is okay although those i recognised have all been in better things... most obviously stephen rea and jeffrey combs... i kept waiting for the latters character to become more important but he never did. overall id not really recommend this it is just about okay but nothing more.",negative
"three best buds and a youngun hop into a hot tub in 2010, spill some junk in the gears, and wind up in 1986, where they struggle to preserve the spacetime continuum while still being funny, disgusting, andor crude. theyre mildly successful in this somewhatfunny throwback to the skilodge jocks vs. dorks movies of the 1980s that teeters between being a laughoutloud dip in nostalgia and a simple knock off of a funnier movie last years the hangover. john cusack is adam, a sad sack pitiful wreck whose vengeful girlfriend has just dumped him, taking almost everything in the house. craig robinson late of zach and miri make a porno is nick, a married man shackled to his deadend job as a highend groomer. rob corddry is lou, whos even more pathetic when he drunkenly attempts suicide, the other two tell him in the hospital that theyre all going to a legendary camp at which they all partied back in the day. they bring along adams grown nephew jacob clark duke, for no other reason than to have some kind of moral compass. somehow, the hot tub at their cabin in the mountains magically transports them to when they were, well, young and dumb, with their entire lives in front of them. in fact, as luck would have it, theyre all except for jacob in the same place they were 20 years prior, at the site of the winterfest musicandfun extravaganza where each of them did something that forever altered their life paths. which, if we know our movie timetraveling logic, means that they cant do anything this time around, or else theyll risk screwing their own futures up. at first glance, you might think that cusack plays the everyman of the group, but thats not necessarily the case here. hes a downonhisluck schmuck, like lloyd dobler in say anything , or even rob gordon in high fidelty, but hes also kind of a crass jackhole, which is not a role cusack normally plays. but hes not a complete jerk, either he just sort of disappears into a vapid, staticy role that almost melts into the chaotic scenery. it almost feels as if he were cast purely because he used to be in these movies in the 80s himself, unlike his costars. but that would be about the only reason. cusacks adam isnt an underdog fighting the rich bullies hes really playing the role of best bud. the problem is that theres no main dude for him to be the best bud to, and lets be honest john cusack is no wingman, anyway. luckily, rob corddry playing the selfish jerk of the bunch is able to swoop in and shamelessly steal the movie. its like stealing a grain of sand from the sahara. corddry is all energy, all angst and anger and bald head and rage and hormones and id, lots and lots of id. all id, all the time with lou. his scenes and there are many really perk everyone up, raising chaos up a few notches. the movie glosses over an interesting dilemma, though if you went back in time, to when you were just entering your adult years, would you make the same decisions you made the first time around? the guys here get that opportunity, and some deviate from their norm a little bit. and some things get deviated for them, too. reference is made to the stupid ashton kutcher movie the butterfly effect, something something about how if a butterfly flaps its wings in one hemisphere, a calamity occurs in another hemisphere. i believe this is actually chaos theory, but lets not quibble. so whether by accident or on purpose, their behavior alters everything. but since this is a comedy thats a bit lighter than, say, back to the future, i dont think we need to worry too much about whatll happen when they do get back to good ol 2010. in all, hot tub time machine is a good throwback movie. its entertaining if you went through the 1980s, certainly and the period music is pretty damn awesome, and if you didnt, youll have plenty to laugh at. the actors give engaging performances, but the jokes are often lackluster. in fact, if anything there should have been far more homages to 80s films. can you believe this movie was set in a ski lodge and set in the 1980s, and yet there was only the slightest passing reference to cusacks quintessential 80s hit better off dead? shame.",negative

"billy wilders the apartment was one of a huge list of movies that are considered classics which i havent seen, and indeed knew very little about other than the level of admiration which many people have for it. having a vague knowledge of the stars of the film jack lemmon, shirley maclaine, for one reason or another i was expecting a lighthearted comedy filled with innuendo and witty banter, a tradition of filmmaking that was common around the period when this film was released. thankfully i wasnt disappointed, as these elements are all in play in the apartment, but what really thrilled and surprised me was the much more serious subject matter that the film deals with. to say this is simply a comedy is completely false, as its a somewhat dark and daring study of the nature of love and infidelity, and the stunning performances and filmmaking on display had me enthralled from the first frame. the film certainly begins as a comedy. c.c. baxter lemmon is a young bachelor trying to ascend the corporate ladder by allowing a group of his superiors to use his apartment for their extramarital liaisons. after he falls for charismatic elevator attendant fran maclaine, who is engaged in an illicit relationship with mr. sheldrake, the married head of the company, baxter tries to free himself from the demands of his bosses, with hilarious results. while this is certainly risqu subject matter for 1960, the film takes an unexpectedly sombre turn when fran makes a suicide attempt in the apartment after learning the truth behind sheldrakes motives. what follows is a touching, and at times heartwrenching flowering of baxter and frans relationship, and if the ending is a little predictable, the journey getting there is really something wonderful. the apartment features an excellent selection of fullyformed support characters, but the film really belongs to lemmon and maclaine. lemmons reputation as cinemas greatest everyman is really on show here, and its impossible not to root for him and sympathise with his plight. playing baxter as a charming yet awkward underdog, his character is the embodiment of the nice guys finish last maxim, and although some elements of his life may be a little shady to say the least, lemmon is flawless. maclaine is completely up to lemmons high standard as fran, effortlessly making audiences fall in love with her just as baxter has. shes just so damn cute that even when shes recovering from an overdose of sleeping pills, she exudes such a potent girl next door allure that cant be avoided. her chemistry with lemmon is palpable, and when they inevitably end up together, its one of those truly satisfying romantic moments seen all too rarely in modern cinema. im not usually one to get nostalgic when it comes to film periods, but while i do have great fondness for many more recent romantic comedies, hollywood really doesnt make movies like the apartment any more. wilders screenplay cowritten with i.a.l. diamond is clever, witty and engaging, particularly in the subtle motifs and unique idiosyncrasies of all the characters, and the film is just so expertly crafted. im determined now to seek out more wilder films, along with catching up on my jack lemmon and shirley maclaine. i cant recommend the apartment highly enough!",positive

"this is my first review of a series. but theres a first time for everything, so here goes! my brother told me about this show. thanks bro! ok. i watched the pilot first, naturally, and i liked it, its good, but then the second episode is just incredible. and then it just gets better and better. and better and better and better. each episode is so creative, so much fun, such a ride. the writing is, yeah, so creative. creative is a word that is thrown around way too much these days, but this show is really creative. like, for reals. for reals yall. its not that easy to explain what makes it so good.. its about a boy and his super genius grandfather, and they go on unbelievable adventures to other universes and dimensions. sounds cool, but you have to see it to understand how cool it actually is. some of these story lines, they are not like anything else ive ever seen. the awesomeness of the story lines overshadow everything else, i think, but besides the actual plots of each episode there is a lot to like. the characters are fun, the jokes are really good, smart and fun. the animation is rather simple, but very good. so many fun creatures and wacky worlds. its just a blast to lose yourself in each episode. if you like scifi, like at all, you just have to check this out. i love it. its almost.. genius.",positive
"this show is entertaining. the characters are funny and likeable, the school children are adorable, and it shows the lives of the people who choose to become teachers for the better good. but it has its issues. for starters, the acting is sometimes forced. the script isnt always great and could use improvement. it also tries really hard to be an office or parks and rec, but it has a totally different vibe. so it shouldnt try and depend its success so much on that. i know its a show, but the office and parks and rec still kept some kind of reality in their worlds. with this show, i have to give it the benefit of the doubt just to keep watching it. michael scott was a weird manager, but a good manager. the principle in this show is just plain incompetent and unlikable. because this is about kids and a school, its hard to believe teachers have time in between their day to talk like they do and do what they do without impacting their work. its something we as viewers need to accept as television. this show is entertaining, but if it wants to survive, it needs to pick up its game. some jokes feel lazy, and the acting is sometimes sub par which i blame on the bad scripts. it had potential. lets hope it does better in season 2!",positive
"some like it hot 1959 focuses upon two musicians who witness a murder and must go on the run from the mob, eventually hiding out in an allgirls jazz band. it finds most of its comedy from its stars bumbling attempts to balance their drag personas with their real ones. curtis character falls in love with monroes lead singer and decides to use inside knowledge gained as her female friend to woo her, while lemmons character who often struggles to refrain from getting too excited, shall we say has to contend with an old millionaire who has fallen in love with him. contrary to what you may expect, the movie isnt all that problematic. it has aged rather well, with its humour almost constantly being goodnatured and with its messages actually being somewhat progressive. for the most part, the piece plays out as a farce. it has moments of drama and moments of romance but comedy is its major focus. occasionally, its quite funny. its also typically rather entertaining. it isnt massively compelling, though, and it starts to sag a bit in its midsection. this overall lack of engagement brings the things highlights down somewhat. still, its a good effort. 610",positive
purely awful... in the words of jodie foster while crying there are no words...they should have sent a poet to describe the depths of this atrocity. its so bad it crosses from the realm of terrible into ironically good back into terrible again and then finally making a stop at vomit inducing hilarity. oh and if you wanna make the movie even funnier. go to rifftrax.com and download the audio supplemental track. they are the writers and stars of mystery science theater 300... its cheap and i guarantee that if you find this movie to be funny then you will love this audio track. if you need anymore recommendations for shitty movies just send me a message though the imdb site.,negative

"dazed and confused is a must watch coming of age movie. while it displays events that common audiences love on the screen, it lacks the small things that result in it not being anything great. in the first act of this film, we learn pretty quickly that there isnt much of a plot. but there is one simple task at hand, and that is for a group of high school students to have a memorable first day of summer. this simple plot results in there being lots of cheesy dialogue, cliched moments and even a predictable soundtrack. that being said, you are still able immerse yourself in this film. the relatability of this one day event keeps your eyes glued to the screen. linklater is able to direct this movie as truthful as one could, bringing back nostalgic memories of our first time out on the town. the performances put on by the actors are all pretty serviceable, except for two. pink jason london shows us what the high school life is like, balancing between school, parties and football. and on the other hand matthew mcconaughey reminds us all why he was brought into the acting scene. besides the obvious flaws this movie was set up to have and some audio syncing that could have easily been prevented, i managed to still enjoy myself. if you were once a high school student, i can see yourself doing the same.",positive
"the whole movie is a good fun time, the movie doesnt have much of a plot, but if your looking for a fun movie then this is the one for you. i thought the action was fine, mostly too bloody and i think therefore its a little dull when it does come to the action. but other then that this feel had plenty of laughs, hugh is one of the best casting choices of all time, and ryan has a stella performance as deadpool once again. the chemistry is on point, they both have some laughs, its the same type of humour youd expect, and i understand it might not be for everyone, i completely understand. deadpools first installment had many laughs too, but yes the humour can be a thing of the past, i did have some laughs though however. i sincerely hope you enjoy the movie, its dumb fun and fantastic. top marks from me!",positive
"brilliant. the characters are very easy to dislike because of their sense of entitlement, arrogance and complete disregard for others.....and yet its so easy to like this show. there are some laugh out loud moments. i noticed one review gave this 1 star because the bad language and sexual nature was unnecessary. i disagree. i am aware that a lot of wealthy people use foul language freely. its also worth remembering that there are a lot of wealthy people that are bored by the type of things the rest of us find enjoyable. they have the money to go more extreme. for me, this show could easily be a realistic look into a wealthy family dynasty. its simply marvellous tv.",positive

"its quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie, blending comedy and drama with such naturalness thats why intouchables is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving. funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude theres brutal honesty in representing the real condition of philippe, as well as drisss initial uncompassionate attitude. there are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between francois cluzet and omar sy sparkles and captures the viewers attention. i was swept away by drysss genuine smile as well as by philippes melancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feelinggood sentiment. definitely, a mustsee picture.",positive

"on the unusual decent rating of three stars out of five, i.e., six out of ten the film has been thrashed since the launch of the teaser, and i had given up completely on the movie. countless negative reviews, memes, trolled trailers, and commentary on the poor dialogue and vfxthe stream of critique on the movie was endless. i just went in anticipating the worst thing. and when the movie was over, i felt it was not that bad. gets an extra star just because i was sensitized to bad bits, and the good bits felt decent, so it ended up been an anticlimactic experience for me. had i gone in blind, i would have rated it either one or two... the anticipation of absolute worst helped. also the acceptance of the movie being a looselyadapted film based on ramayanajust another action flickhelped me to just relax and watch it without the burden of negative publicity. dont do the folly of equating it to the ramayana despite what the title, the moviemakers, or other people affiliated with the movie saylife will be much easier that way otherwise, all you will see is endless flaws, and then even negative stars would be insufficient to rate the movie. coming to the movie major things that did not work for me a prabhas onetone angry man look. it has been six years since baahubali 2 released, and he is still caught in that baahubali mold. awful. all his tseries flicks, including saaho and radhe shyam, have been horrendous. perhaps it was the genius of rajamouli and freshness of prabhas to nontelugu audiences that shined in the baahubali duology. b color grade of the film even in a 4k premiere theater with a 3d show, the entire film looks so dark. many things are not visible at all, which might have been done to hide the many valid criticisms when the teaser was launched. no day shots or lack of light felt so off throughout the film. c animation there are several interesting, nice bits of vfx and animation in the film mixed with equally poor, lowquality, horrendous effects. the most notable of the poor animation shots being everything to do with the vanar army lord rams army and lanka army ravanas army. the sequence of bali and sugriva fight was simply yuck. several of the animation shots were simply unrefined and done without due attention to the detail. the intro scene of lord ram also felt shoddy i was like what the heck are dementors doing in the film . major thing that worked for me a sound the sound department did good not talking about the music here. perhaps it was the atmos effect, or the choice of my seating to be in the dead center of the theatre, that the sound effects and design felt good throughout the movie. b watching on a big screen in 3d. the scenes getting trolled everywhere did not look that bad in a big, goodquality theatre. also some visual effects looked nice. c once you accept that the film is very loosely based on the original text, i liked the dark, evil and comical in parts portrayal of ravana and lanka. although i am sure that i am in a rare company here. on om raut i liked his lokmanya ek yugpurush, and thought that tanaji was okayishsubpar at best unlike how much people enjoyed it. the difference in quality of the two films is fairly evident when you switch from a real movie like lokmanya into the use of vfx and animation heavy film like tanhaji. tanhaji felt unreal, visually dark, and unrefined in the cgi domain. alas it at least had some live action unlike adipurush where they bit more than they could cheweverything looks so cartoonish. very little feels live action, which is a major bane of the film. on manoj muntashir shukla i did not give much attention to the dialogues, so no commentsalthough i can firmly say that at least the dialogues were not as awful as in brahmastra .",negative

"chetan bhagats five point someone may not be called a literary masterpiece, but it sure is entertaining with its guffaws and its indianized english. i read the book a while back, and i was highly impressed by the authors straightforward and vitriolic views about the sagacious education system. bhagat had introduced ryan oberoi to play the role of the rebel, an anarchist who wanted to do away with the grumpy system of education prevailing in india. ryan was never his protagonist he simply played the second fiddle in the book. it was hari, the mundane narrator of the book who was the hero. but things turned topsyturvy when bollywood walked into the scene to dramatize the already dramatic story of five point someone. and then when in the book everything went happily ever after with the three idiots, namely ryan, hari, and alok, bollywood begot its own idiots farhaan r. madhavan, raju sharmaan joshi and rancho aamir khanthe great for its new cinematic endeavor 3 idiots . 3 idiots can be summed up in one word as extremely majestic. it surely will make you laugh your guts out with its slapstick jokes, its funny sequences, its bathetically emotional scenes and make you to shed a tear or two in the emotional sequences. in short, 3 idiots is a perfect desi dinner for your bulbous eyes which has all the spices in almost perfect proportion. the genetically modified melodrama has all it takes to hit the indian audiences hard, and i see it topping the charts in no time. the movie definitely followed a major part of the book, only the incidents were either jumbled or heightened for greater effect. 3 idiot is a laughter riot right from the first scene where farhaan fakes a heart attack while onboard an air india flight to the last scene where chatur finds out that his role model mr. phunsuk wangdu is none but his college rival rancho. i especially loved the portrayal of rajus glum family in black and white. despite scenes of hilarity, 3 idiots does suffer from backlogs of vague emotions which seem at some portions of the movie vaguely put on, unorganized and unneeded. another thing that stuck me was the heroic character of rancho. i know it doesnt look good for the perfect image of a movie if its hero fails to live up to the standard and flunks in exams or scores 5 point something, so bollywood made ryan oberoi of the book alias rancho become the class topper thus bringing forth the idea that we cannot still accept a flawed hero in our movies. in the long run, the act actually exemplified the character of rancho and brought out the real essence of the movie. but the child delivery scene in the movie was definitely overtly exaggerated. i dont think chetan bhagat has ever imagined his ryan to do a child delivery with the aid of his friends. since everything is fair in bollywood and war, such sacrileges add to the vivacity of the movies plot. 3 idiots is a star studded affair which presents us with the grand acting skills of stars like boman irani as professor.viru sahastrabuddhe or omi vaidya as chatur ramalingam. but kareena kapoor seemed a little unwanted as pia, she didnt add to the character of the fashion designing student neha of the book, instead she is here a smart would be doctor who falls for the charm of rancho out of the blue. one thing that stuck me about the movie is the way the real ages of the stars have been camouflaged fruitlessly. even though aamir khan is a perfectionist as an actor, he seemed a little too old to be an engineering student in his early twenties. nevertheless, the movie is a first hand example of great filmatography and fabulous humor. like all rajkumar hirani movie, this one has treats for all its viewers. the peppy song aal izz well reminds us of his munna bhai movies. the dialogues used in the movie will definitely come as eye openers to brainless muggers. 3 idiots deftly bring out the very quintessence of five point someone bringing to light the fatal flaws of the indian education system. and though at some point aamir khan does look like a knowitall holy spirit inculcating others with his words, he does reciprocate chetan bhagats ideas that the indian education system lacks creativity and spontaneous love for knowledge. i hope aamirs words reach the generation next and come as a harbinger of a utopian vision of a new educational system in india. movies with messages such as this one should be taken as ground breaking attempts to change society. the movie is an absolute delight when it comes to music. it features a galaxy of beautiful songs shot in great locations. i personally loved behti hawa and zoobie doobie. overall, 3 idiots is a wonderfully heartwarming movie that teaches us to stop being mentally troglodytes and introduce creativity in our minds.",positive
"the films first few narration seems to state that in 1971 there happened a war between india and pakistan. false. it was an war between bangladesh and pakistan. bangladesh, the then east pakistan, was under west pakistans governance after 1947. because of injustices to the bangladeshi people by the pakistani government, the bangladeshis fought a war against the pakistani military. the war started on 25th of march, 1971 and ended with a victory of bangladesh on 16th of december, 1971. india helped bangladeshi people to overcome pakistani military and indian military took part in the war on 3rd december, 1971. it was never a war between india and pakistan but a war between bangladesh and pakistan in which bangladesh got independence. here is the wikipedia link for more information httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikibangladeshliberationwar so, how could the film gunday violate a countrys history? we, the bangladeshi people, want apology from the narrator, director and production company of this film.",negative
"i am a big fan of the kings, and when the character elsbeth was introduced in the good wife and reappeared in the good fight, she was entertaining and refreshing. she had an offthewall courtroom presence. when you first saw her on a case, you figured her defence was doomed to fail. but then she came up with a twist or reinterpretation of the facts that made all the difference. she was not in every episode of either series, and that kept her from becoming cloying. but now the kings feel that she merits a show of her own, and that is becoming too much of what was a good thing in smaller doses. the episodes are feeling repetitive, and things are not helped by portraying the crime and the criminal in the initial minutes. the rest of the show just becomes filler how does this wacky person figure out what we already know? sorry, but this just doesnt measure up to the expectations that were created by elsbeths earlier and occasional appearances.",positive
a journey of reawakening in a country like ours gore vidal called it the united states of amnesia the absurdity of the behavior in the southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. viggo mortensen is sheer perfection as the all american italian. the opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and mahershala ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that mortensen and ali infuse their characters with. i loved them and green book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. it leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps were not there yet but that we are on our way. happy new year!,positive

"a family swap houses for a vacation and end up in a town occupied by trollsgoblins who can morph into human form. the trolls try to feed them green goo to make them transform into edible plants. it has to be said troll 2 is a truly terrible film. these films are made for teenagers that rented vhs tapes of charles bands full moon films or troma for a few laughs with their friends. troll 2 delivers on laughs, awful special effects, but it lacks a bit in the gore department. its worth pointing out in every bad movie there is at least one good actor. michael paul stephenson as joshua, the little boy who is sort of the lead role is better than most of the adult actors apart from deborah reed who plays a troll queen and really goes for it, hamming it up, every facial expression really turned up to the nth degree, knowingly giving viewers exactly what they expect and being sexy with it. a documentary was made by actor, michael paul stephenson and is favourably reviewed. i do like guilty pleasure films and try to see the good in most films, but while far from the worst film ever made it is difficult to recommend because its bad on every level. on censorship the film was passed in the uk uncut with an 18 certificate for vhs. it was downgraded to a 15 for dvd. for comparison the film has less violence than 15 rated final destination.",negative
"frank zappa said it all about gigli on the 1976 album zoot allures, during track number three the torture never stops. bad films come in many configurations. there are films so bad that they are funny in a reversed sort of way. there are films so bad one cannot watch the end of them because they are too boring. then there are films that are so bad they become a sort of perverse endurance test, the kind of film that dares you to turn it off before the end credits roll. unfortunately, gigli is definitely the third kind. aside from having the worst principal cast this side of an ed wood production, the story is so utterly incompetent it defies all rational explanation more on that anon. when released upon a gobsmacked public, gigli attracted such terrible reviews that theatres in england never gave it a second week. david letterman began to use it as a regular punchline about films so excruciatingly bad one would have to be mad to watch them. and therein lies one of the big problems. gigli is merely mediocre. the worst parts first. whomever had the idea of casting ben affleck to play a mob enforcer must have been drunk, stoned, or both. he is about as intimidating as robert de niros infant grandrelatives, and probably about as muscular in the forearm. he is watchable when he is not trying to pretend to be the archetypal toughguy, but when the script requires him to be intimidating, the whole thing comes apart. the second big mistake was casting jennifer lopez as a higher mob enforcer called in to supervise affleck and clean up his mistakes. to say that this stretches credulity to the outer limits is like saying that casting jennifer lopez in a film is a bad idea. but by far the worst problem for gigli is a script that could have been written by trained monkeys who drank paint for weeks on end for all we know. the scripts attempts at humour often revolve around the correct pronunciation of giglis name, a joke that gets tired about one reel in. it would have been a wiser move to build jokes around the fact that it really is pronounced giggly. but by far the worst mistake of the script lies in the central premise. it all starts with gigli getting a call asking him to kidnap the retarded brother of a judge who is hearing a case involving one of the big bosses. the people ordering gigli to perform this kidnapping hope that they can intimidate the judge into ruling favourably for their boss. the boss in question, played in cameo by al pacino, apparently did not authorise this course of action, and no wonder. kidnapping is an incredibly serious offense under federal law, and ordering it could get anyone put away for life. granted, mob bosses like to keep all sorts of failsafes in place so that a case can never be made that they did in fact order such a course of action, but this is beside the point. exactly what prompted the underboss in question to order this course of action without authority from the boss himself is something nobody who understands organised crime is ever going to figure out. hence, the whole film regards its audience as a bunch of morons. another big problem for the film is that it cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. the central premise duels between comedy and mobster drama. the principal actors seem to think they are on a teenie soap opera. the editor seems to think he is meant to be making a lengthy epic. the director seems to think he is directing a music video. all of these elements combine to make an incoherent, unfocused pile of nonsense that must have been as confusing for the crew as it was for the audience. what little audience there was in theatres, anyway. word about how terrible gigli was spread so fast that after a mere two weeks in us theatres, gigli limped away with a gross of six million and change against a fiftyfour million dollar investment. not surprisingly, the film was available on dvdvideo faster than most films finish their theatrical engagement. martin brest has not directed a film since, in spite of previously being involved in some solid works such as beverly hills cop. in any case, gigli soon became a job that everyone involved would rather forget. and the sad thing is that unlike battlefield earth, gigli is not even bad in a funny way. it just basically sits there and shows you its offensiveness, as if mocking you for not only choosing a bad film at that particular moment, but for the fact that it managed to con various suckers into contributing more than fifty million dollars to its making. in that sense, it is like an australian or british prime minister that nobody wants to be led by, but they just cannot get rid of. these days, it is all too easy for people who think they are connoisseurs of bad cinema, but are not, to label the director of a bad film the new ed wood. the thing is, ed wood consistently made films that were endearing in an especially terrible way because he was so enthusiastic to make films that he never noticed how bad he was at making them. the people involved in gigli know they have made a bad film, and they have gone to great pains either to hide that fact, or to negate its presence in their resume. it is cynical filmmaking at its absolute worst. even if it is so much fun to see jennifer lopez kill what is left of her unremarkable career. for that reason, i gave gigli a one out of ten. it works best as a test of how much you and your bad filmloving friends can really endure.",negative
"time, money, talent. all wasted with this redundant nonsensical meandering knockoff of every actionfantasydrama film made in the last 5 years. at one point, jasons character was hoping around kicking bad guys like the transporter, transported to middle earth. there are so many areas in the plot curved filled with other movies bits and pieces that nothing really gels. most of the key secondary actors pretty much where robots. there is no positive defense for this turd. why did one of the kings special guards fire an arrow with a bell on it into a tree? nothing was done with this little tidbit of plot. this film felt like all the actors involved were fulling some public service agreement for too many parking tickets.",negative
"this has to be the absolute nadir of genre filmmaking. a 20 million dollar budget to produce this crap, ten decent low budget features could have been produced for the same price. performances that range from embarrassing to oh my god what was that? visual effects that set the digital revolution back about ten years. some of the worst one liners in the recent history of cinema and a silly extended but unfunny cameo from the hoff himself. all this negative criticism is coming from someone who rated the first one an eight, but the director here seems to have fallen asleep in his chair and forgotten to pen a halfway decent script. a handful of prepubescent boys out there may find the barrage of boobs enough to sustain its scant 80 odd minutes i didnt! utter garbage!",negative
"abbott elementary 2021 is one of the best sitcoms of modern day television. positives for abbott elementary 2021 this is a comfort sitcom where you can just cool out and enjoy these characters going their usual school day lives at willard r. abbott elementary school. the cast does a great job with their character from quinta brunson as janine teagues, tyler james williams as gregory eddie, janelle james as ava coleman, lisa ann walter as melissa schemmenti, chris perfetti as jacob hill, sheryl lee ralph as barbara howard and william stanford davis as mr. johnson. they are such enjoyable characters and watching them teach their students is fun. i also enjoy how fun and smart this show with its use of humor and it feels natural for these characters and their situations. and finally, i just appreciate how this is one of the few modern day shows that actually releases new season on a yearly bases, so i can enjoy these characters and their relationships with each other. overall, abbott elementary 2021 is one of the best comfort sitcom ive watched and i cant wait to see more of these characters in season 5.",positive
"a little over 20 years later and rewatching this is as good, if not better than the first time i saw it. the concept was amazing at the time and still is relevant, storytelling, directing and acting are absolutely on point. these days when i watch older movies one of my thoughts is should i recommend this old thing to my teenage nieces and nephews and retain my cool uncle status? and few of them are as a resounding absolutely! as this movie.",positive
"its obvious that the people who made this have no feel for the characters or the comics. the story is full of holes, lacks logic why did the red skull cut off his own hand to escape cap instead of plunging the knife into caps chest? and why was there no blood gushing from the skulls wrist? while they did some things right they did manage to make matt salinger look scrawny before the experiment, overall it was another attempt to take a character with a long history in the comics and put the filmmakers own spin on it to poor effect. captain america is a great character, and id love to see him done right, but after two poor tv movies and this wasted effort, i just dont think theres anyone in hollywood whos willing to take the chance and make movie about a straight arrow superhero.",negative
"right, well. i work in a cinema and we get staff screenings of films. so i thought to all who are wanting to see it australians, unless its still not released elsewhere to do something constructive with the time you would spend with this film. i just got home from it and i can safely say its one of the worst films ive ever seen, if not the worst. the good. slightly funny references to mtv pop culture. the bad. its a disgrace to the classic and or brilliant films we all enjoy. boring predictable, as a parody film usually is. unoriginal silly the humor is just pointless use of slapstick , lame sexual humor, and manipulating other films in a predictable way. a waste of time. the villon bady of the films name is the white bitch of gnarnia, originating from the white witch of narnia. congrats guys, you can think of words that rhyme! its not even bad enough to laugh at. in comparison to another bad film, snakes on a plane, was humorous as it was so poorly done. this however is just lame. rating 110 there was no 0 option",negative
"for me billy wilder has always been one of my all time favourite directors and he has not made a single film that has not appealed to me. billy wilder sums up perfection all his films manage to succeed in what they set out to do. billy wilder is not just one of the greatest directors he is also one of the finest scriptwriters ever. creating flowing dialogue like no other and perfectly making his actors and actresses work with the script brilliantly. billy wilder has made dark noirs, hilarious musicals and studies of human nature. it is extremely difficult to fully describe a director as versatile and genius as billy wilder. his films have held up for generations and will continue to have the same mass appeal that his films have had since their opening days. on the surface the apartment might seem like a comedy and yes thats what it is on the surface. once you start watching the apartment you realise that actually it is a very dark film underneath and actually has characters that contemplate suicide. the fact is that the apartment captures the realism of the everyday workman and makes you laugh as well as feel pity. the script is what keeps the film moving and shows how the characters in the apartment change as the film progresses. the apartment is about becoming somebody rather than being something that someone uses. jack lemmon creates c.c. baxter the young aspiring workman who just wants to have a good career and the perfect woman. though something always goes wrong and hes perfectly able to get a woman, but not the one he wants. at times you pity c.c. baxter because hes so kind to everyone and never gets the thing he wants in return because something will always get in the way. i think there are times in every mans life where you probably feel like c.c. baxter in one way or another. jack lemmon perfectly progresses with his character to make himself one of the most distinguishable character actors ever. jack lemmon works with an elegant skill at comedic performances and always captures the true essence of his characters. he seems to be one of those actors who are able to find the perfect chemistry with his fellow cast. what makes c.c. baxter so brilliant is the fact he stands for everything the film is about. he becomes one of the mot uplifting and joyous ever put on screen. shirley maclaine is also excellent as the lovable fran kubelik c.c. baxters heartthrob. from first impressions youd think she is a beautiful and happy women, but shes actually very different to what you might expect. the script is fast paced, memorable and most of all it helps sum up all the characters so well. its a script that works so easily with its actors and helps to make some of the most superb character situations. the script is realistic as well and actually does feel like the kind of talk that would be used in similar situations in life. the script is extremely natural and the subtle undertones prove billy wilders crafting of intellectual filmmaking. the film is actually very similar to that of its a wonderful life and you could say jack lemmon is very similar to that of james stewart. the direction is simple and fulfilling. it captures the image of the apartment perfectly and though just like any other new york apartment it feels extremely likable and memorable. the films use of music is another high point and feels perfectly hand picked for the scenes its used in. the film is actually quite sexually vibrant and does have many sexual undertones in its dialogue. though subtle, it definitely is there and perfectly helps add more subtext to the film as a whole. a film to be studied in depth and not just watched. a film that never gets old and always manages to make the viewer feel uplifted with happiness. a first class example of perfected filmmaking youre ever going to see. yes its a definitive mustsee, a masterpiece that was way ahead of its time and much more than just a movie.",positive
"this movie was the most random thing i have seen in a long time. things like entire scenes filmed with nightshot cameras and music from the 8th grade help this fact. the summary says it all, but more importantly, how did they get fairly popular actors like chris klein and rebecca romijnstamos to do this? sure, ll did deep blue sea, but even that was better. this was a really, really bad idea and movie.",negative

"dharma productions is on the verge of having a streak of underwhelming films starting with kalank and now this one. the prequel has that lightness and overwhelmingness depsite some flaws it had and now the soty team decided to go beyond their redemption by keeling a sequel for the audience. so the story evolves around a middle class chap rohan mehra who scores a seat under the sports quota in saint theresa. mridula a.k.a mia is rohans childhood crush who is also a student there and shreya, the most popular gal in the institution. manav is the son of one of the trustees as well as shreyas brother who has a cold shoulder with rohan with the ambition of defeating him to become student of the year. how rohans ambitious dreams come true basically forms the backbone of the story. what was punit malhotra smoking before coming up with such a cocaphonous flick? the story was very predictable and too nepotistic because of what power and influence of one person can do to another person who doesnt have these traits. dialogues were too dramabaazi meaning too 80s for such a delicate film. acting had some slight redemption but only for the newcomers. tiger shroff acts basically like he is auditioning for a film for the first time just like his other films. too much fighting and just seeing him kick ass and dance isnt going to make acting a redeeming quality. tara sutaria was the only potential figure in the acting department because she had that natural glow of a college student and she was decent throughout the movie. ananya pandey was also decent and she didnt disappoint at all. she had that personality of a popular college girl with snobbiness which is something to look for in a popular gal. aditya seal didnt do much besides bullying rohan throughout the film and same like tiger shroff, same identities but opposite. samir soni, gul panag, and ayesha raza were fine as well but had short roles as they were educational figures. music was very average at best and no song stood out as such although jawaani was a beautiful recreation but evrything else around was subpar. seems like vishal and shekhar overthought some things while composing. cinematography was well executed by ravi k. chandran who shot dehradhun beautifully but transitionally, it was loose in terms of editing. overall, too nepotistic and predictable 25 grading scale f 53",negative
"wow! am i the only one who understands what this film is really all about? i think most of you need to rewatch this film. its a landscape of reality twisted into a skewed vision of the world which is stripped of all its formalities. lol! insanity. visually surreal, like the paintings of the 1920s. there are so may layers to this film, i almost grabbed what it was, but then it was gone. its like a childrens story book for the adults real world. an amazing landscape, amazing colors and characters. a journey through ones own psyche. i believe its one of the best films ive seen in the last year.",positive
"before i began my analysis of the sting, i studied how george roy hill works with neuman and redford in butch sundance and how he manipulates his story in slaughterhousefive. i noticed that hill never worries about impressions in his work, he only wants to entertain the audience at the expense of whatever brain cells they lose in the process. consider his working of slaughterhousefive, one of the greatest antiwar books ever written. he strips it of fluidity, adds in his comic touches, then slaps the viewer in the head and makes you feel stupid for watching it in the beginning. thats how all his films work. the sting relies on similar principles. characters are not people, they are scenes to be created. hill is much like richard donner and tennessee williams in that respect. notice how neuman and redford plan their great con at the end. its all a facade to show that the film shakes on its feet like jello. overall, dont bother with this movie. if you want grhs best work, just watch butch cassidy and the sundance kid again. 2 out of 5 stars.",positive

"this show is made of engineers by engineers for engineers. its a mammoth fest of technocratic dudes who try to imagine away their stale dull lives spent typing coma inducing code into a paradise where they are still coding coma inducing programs but now, they are their own prisonmasters. the creators of the show, like all engineers have a thumbrule algorithmic approach to storytelling as they call it, since on closer inspection, it resembles more like hallucinated tumbling forth of incidents which somehow all come together in the end, albeit through some cute sentimentality like the speech of a management executive at the end of episode 5. sentimental coddling of the generation is the new fashion and tvf is milking this. of course all this is not deliberate as the people in real lives probably live such trivialized lives themselves. its a testament to how much pitchers appeals to our melodramatic and over sentimentalized, puppy love generation that there is not one bad rating in imdb for this. the only other time such unanimous applause was seen in the annals of an indian work of rt, it was gunda, a timeless favorite of all engineers. tvf has got together a singular bunch of urban bards spinning yarns of meticulous nonsense quite in tune with the culture around. so no blame to them. but to applaud a miserable bunch of peter pans with their unique problems of work life and bubbling with easy platitudes at every step is an insult to the whole paradigm of praise itself. dudes, you can get all your funding and set up your companies but life is infinitely tougher and the real problems of your codedriven existence are still a deteriorating marital and sex life, a loss of morals and the emptiness of modern distractions, one of which is shows like yours. if you really want to be the voice of the generation as you never shy of boasting, read some literature assuming you have patience, try getting inside the hearts of men and women and figure out whats ails your generation so much.the engineer is a symbol of the vacuity of modern life and exalting him to the status of a modern mythical figure as youre trying is not just stupid, its saddening.",negative

"disney, creatively still at rock bottom, is struggling to find commercial hits in the interests of its shareholders. this means that overpaid heads, whatever their qualifications, sit down together and, instead of creating something new, consider which former success they could reissue. this time, the choice fell on what is probably the last popular character. respect! is there at least a great story? no. our heroine embarks on another journey, this time to ensure the continuation of the species according to mendels rules. but it doesnt matter, the young target audience should and will enjoy the impressive visuals and the tried and tested characters. fortunately, there are also some entertaining new ones, even if they are insufficiently illuminated. it is and remains a childrens film, there is no room for dramaturgical necessity! doesnt it? its been done differently in this genre and children shouldnt be underestimated, let alone taken for fools or even made to feel stupid. the soundtrack is undeniably uninspiring, a barely memorable singsong. thanks to the power of the media, the film will make considerably more money in the 2020s, even with considerably less quality. that is the commercial definition of art these days, that means success. attention, another piece of good news for muana hardliners who can no longer be deterred. disneys wealth of ideas has yet another highlight a liveaction film adaptation is coming. pathetic. and probably muana 3, with considerably less waiting time, because there are no new concepts.",negative
"i for one really liked this movie. well im sure it wasnt as bleak as the book and while i tend to really like bleak toned art, this was a perfectly acceptable movie. i havent actually read the book to properly judge this, but film is always different. to appeal to a wider audience you cannot make everything depressing and sad. while the story is very simple, so are other movies that are just as good. recently movies have seem to be either very good or very terrible. there are no seven out of 10 movies anymore. it seems this fills the slot. just because the movie is seven out of 10 does not mean its a bad movie.",negative

"dumb and dumberer when harry met lloyd 2003, dir. troy miller its the 80s, and its the moment that lloyd christmas and harry dunne meet. the two individuals are seen by many as special, and become best friends as soon as they meet. principal collins and his lover, the lunch lady, ms. heller want to make as much money out of scams, and their next idea is to create a special needs class. ms. heller is the teacher, and they have assigned harry and lloyd to round the special students up. school news reporter jessica is suspicious though, and desperately tries to find out the truth, even if it means gaining harry and lloyds help. ok, where do i start? if you was a huge fan of dumb and dumber then i advise you to stay clear from this. if you liked the original, and is just interested in what the prequel contains, then dont go into this viewing with high hopes. to sum up this film is one word, i would use bad. just plain bad. the main problem with this film is the jokes. there is a story but only a very basic story, and the jokes are focused on innuendos, which sounds as if they were written by 12 year olds. although some of us might have been 12 when the original film came out, we would definitely not be 12 now. innuendos jokes just does not make a film good, especially when the innuendos jokes arent even that good. the acting is ok. there impersonations of harry and lloyd are not exactly perfect, but they do a good job. the rest of the cast are ok. seeing eugene levy and cheri oteri in a scene together, did actually make me chuckle a little, but eugene levy should have known better to pick a role like this. there are the few other good appearances from stars such as shia labeouf, mimi rogers and lin shaye. still, if i was you, i would only watch it for the performance of a specific actor. come on out, you little b. doctor timothy stack",negative

"i love this movie. i really do. i saw it during its theatrical run and laughed so hard that i literally started crying at one point so when it ended up on dvd, i had to own it. during the yearandahalf that it has been in my dvd library, ive discovered an interesting fact i...cant...stop...watching it. now, why do i enjoy this movie so much and publically p all over the far superior star wars prequels? well, for one thing, i dont have any emotional stock in dd. its a terrible movie with twodimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction, and so many cliches that if you tried making it into a drinking game youd surely die of alcohol poisoning. its never more than it appears to be a potato chip movie. sure, itll rot the brainbut only if you take it seriously which, im afraid, the creative forces behind it did, much to their undoing. star wars, however, does mean something to me...so when i see one of those films and find its riddled with twodimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction and a multitude of cliches, i have to wonder whether or not we even need spaceballs anymore. anyway, i expect more of mr. lucas...but not of courtney solomon. solomon and his screenwriters sought to create a trilogy here to cash in on the star wars phenomenon, and because the anticipation for the first installment of lotr was growing, a fantasy setting seemed an obvious choice. however, the allusions to lotr are slight probably because it had yet to roll off the block but its a nearperfect copy of episode i with a few ot moments thrown in. obviously, after the success of phantom menace, it seemed an easy tomb to rob. the only thing that surprises me is how few critics or fanboys have mentioned it. 1the opening text crawl anytime a fantasyscifi movie opens with either a text or voice reading that sets the stage, were reminded of star wars, which did it perfectly and without the pretentiousness that its imitators embraced. in dd, bruce payne supplies the narrative. its star wars in every way, right down to the way the last sentence trails off but the evil mage profion has other plans..... 2the young queen now, i dont understand why i was the only one with a problem with the concept of queen amidala. first of all, in a monarchy, you dont elect a queen and secondly, if you do, you vote for the candidate who isnt thirteen years old. seriously, how do you lose an election like that...? dd aped this completely. shes young. shes idealistic. shes wooden. she wears godawful dresses and gaudy headpieces. hell, if you want to get really nitpicky about it, you could say that solomon cast thora birch because of the strategicallyplaced moles on her face that suggest amidalas red dot thing. 3the older, trusted advisor whos gone bad instead of palpatine, were treated to profion, the worst role jeremy irons ever took and his equally worst performance. behind the scenes, profion is plotting to overthrow the queen referred to as the empress so as not to seem too blatant a ripoff, and is sowing seeds of discord within the council senate in order to overthrow her rule. his dirty work, however, is saved for his chief lieutenant... 4the dark warrior bruce paynes character, damodar, is equal parts darth vader and darth maul. hes a towering, sadistic, blackclad, slowmoving and unbelievably strong armourclad warrior vader who also happens to be baldheaded and painted with stupidass makeup maul, who didnt look stupidass at all. if this wasnt enough, listen for the thinly disguised echo of the imperial march when he first appears at the magic school. 5lukehan in ridley, we have a combination of the luke and han characters. hes a scoundrel who cares nothing for the greater good, but in the end, is willing to turn aside from his love of money he rejects a pile of easily obtainable gold in favour of saving the kingdom from the evil profion. also we learn that he has latent magical abilities, stemming from his father this was to be expanded upon in the sequels, when damodar tells ridley, noi am your father!. 6jarjar redux marlon wayans. good god, could the allusion be any more transparent. lets see hes a tall, gangly africanamerican stereotype spouting catchphrases, bungling his way in and out of trouble, and generally getting on our beep nerves with his notsofun humour. hell, he even has a hat that resembles a pair of goofy, gunganlike ears. the only satisfaction is that he dies painfully. 7the scoundrel and the good girl like leia and han before them, ridley and marina come from two different worlds hes an opportunistic creep and shes a member of the aristocrisy. at first they bitch at each other to work out the sexual tension but in the end, fall in love, much to our great surprise. 8the mind rape remember when vader interrogated leia, using the mind probe to extract the necessary information? in this movie, he uses a pair of penises that live in his ears. 9lets save the girl from the impenetrable fortress! heyits the only way to steal back the muchsoughtafter plans, right? and while were there, lets have a main character die, allowing for our hero to scream nooooo! while milking a giant cow, no less. 10cities in trees at least the elf cities in lotr looked elegant. the one here looks shockingly similar to the ewok village. 11the swordfight when ridley and damodar have their duel, the clash of their blades creates a lightning effect, rendering the bad guys sabre red and the good guys sabre blue. damodar is finally defeated after ridley does a leap, suckerslashes his foe in the midsection, who then falls over a steep drop. it all seemed vaguely familiar... 12resisting the dark side ridley is momentarily seduced by dark magic during the climax but only by turning aside and embracing the light can he persevere. no! i wont become...you! 13boring politics and bad cgi. come on you know its true. 14splitsecond escape choices when reaching a deadend while pursued by baddies, our heroes take the smelliest possible escape route through the sewers. to reach this destination, they must dive headfirst down a chute where they land in a pool of crp not unlike the death star trash compactor, or all of attack of the clones. 15other blatant ripoffs need i mention how ridley keeps grinning and saying, trust me? or how he goes through the thieves maze, a series of riddles straight out of all three indiana jones movies? or about the scene where marina, bellydown on the floor, is grasping for the scroll, which during the fight, is getting kicked around like a certain diamond in the temple of doom? or how ridley is stabbed in the shoulder and can be healed only by the king of the elves? or that scene where..... you get the point. watch this movie. watch it right now. it might be a hodgepodge of rehashed ideas, but its ten times more entertaining than these new star wars movies. by the way a sequel has been officially greenlit.",positive
"a friend warned me that i would feel disappointed by up. he said it just wasnt as clever and complex as ratatouille or walle or other past pixar offerings. but another friend saw it, and recommended it, so i behooved myself to check it out. i agree with my first friend that up is a narratively relatively modest undertaking. but i also feel that what it does achieve is notable. its taken a while for certain aspects to come to the fore in my mind. however, i did immediately notice one honest and useful moral for all his exertions, fredricksen doesnt get to really have an adventure until he lets go of a frozen, romanticized version of adventure that got stuck in his character makeup at an early age. i thought it was great how the story sets this up and creates the situation where he has this breakthrough. very nicely done. and then there were other interesting things the film achieves. the pacing of the story is odd. in a way, its hard to say whether this reflects daring or ineptitude on the parts of the folks responsible for the shepherding the narrative. but, in the end, i have to say there was something grand about the way the story rolls along slowly and yet also with a lot of strength. its as though it aspires to be operatic with an emotional depth that tries to match the breadth of the spaces and times involved. sort of like waiting for godot meets dennis the menace! i should mention that, about halfway through the film, the pace gets picked up, and stays up for a long time a bit too much, in my book, and quite likely a nod to the kid customers in the audience. and then theres that whole side story of fredricksens deceased wife no spoiler there you see this coming from a mile off. very nicely done. with the proviso that, indeed, you will see something a bit different from prior pixel workno harm in variety!i can recommend this movie.",positive

"some like it hot is not an incredibly artistic, graceful film with deeply significant themes of love and sacrifice its a screwball comedy. yet it is remembered as one of the greatest screwball comedies ever to hit theaters. it is completely overthetop, filled with unlikely situations, bizarre coincidences and quirky characters. jack lemmon and tony curtis, playing joe and jerry, two downandout musicians looking for work in chicago just before the stock market crash of 1929 that would shove america and the world into the great depression. the two witness a killing by al capones goons part of the st. valentines day massacre and desperately try to escape to where they will never be found. without giving away any details, they find themselves in the midst of a rather precarious situation today, perhaps a comedy clich not so then, involving deception, unrequited love, and relationships with a startling number of combinations of genders. there is a great dynamic between the characters of lemmon and curtis. they are in constant competition to win the heart of sugar marilyn monroe, a rebellious and decidedly nave woman who has completely given up on men who are not rich enough to own a yacht. lemmon and curtis are constantly bickering and wanting revenge, yet they are forced to cooperate lest they give away their secret to the onlookers. their story gets convoluted the point where it is difficult to remember which is which, with the storys extremely tight pace and the many twists along the way. one cannot say enough about the about the brilliant comedic acting seen here. jack lemmon and tony curtis are funny not merely because of their dialogue, but because of their wild energy. they slip in and out of roles before they even realize what theyre doing, going from complacent to angry to scared witless without missing a beat. joe e. brown is sure to get under your skin as osgood fielding iii. and marilyn monroe well, she mostly shows a lot of cleavage. ultimately some like it hot is a tightly compressed batch of hilarity. there is a reason why it is listed as the american film institutes 1 comedy although this reviewer doesnt entirely agree with that claim. modern moviegoers shouldnt be turned off by its blackandwhite nature it puts modern buddy comedies to shame.",positive

"gravity falls 20122016 was an interesting show. firstly, i must say that im not really a fan of disney and especially not a fan of disney channel cartoon shows. growing up i always found nickelodeon and wb to have way better kids shows anyways. this disney cartoon series has a darker element to it, and it is heavily loaded with conspiracy theory, masonic symbolism, esoteric mysticism and western mythology. it also gives serious mysterious twin peaks vibes, without having that twin peaks charm. twin siblings dipper and mabel pines spend the summer at their greatuncles tourist trap in the enigmatic gravity falls, oregon. overall, it was a quirky, amusing show, though at times the show doesnt seem to know what it wants to be, a goofy kids show with cheesey, lame kid jokes or a darker adult themed series horror elements, darker imagery. either way it was a fun watch, though definitely overrated in my opinion.",positive

"dont worry i dont intend to dish out spoilers, giving away the synopsis or plot or even a hint on the story line. the movie opens with sanjay dutt narrating the hind sight into the protagonists current state of affairs. i was wondering why sanjay dutts voice was chosen, my roommate was kind enough to educate me on this choice. to start with sanjay dutts voice is kind of synonymous with the comical negative character read gangster, thief ..., attributed to the fame of munna of munna bhai m.b.b.s. the start to the movie though does not leave a bad taste in the mouth, is not what a comedy flick should begin with. the movie lacks a theme or story line that would inherently support the intended comedy. for most part of the movie it seemed that the actors are trying in desperation to make the audience laugh. for example, a meeting of top cops of mumbai chaired by the commissioner discusses the possibility or a lack of ancient treasures getting stolen. gibberish is introduced in the form of a participant interrupting the speaker every few seconds. these puns cry for a few laughs at best, and in time become annoying. akshay kumar seems to have made a resolve to sink deeper with every new comedy flick tmk adds value to that resolve. with such frivolous plot, the burden of carrying the movie rested solely on the shoulders of the actors, and they have done a fine job of letting that slip. katrina kaif with little or no role in the plot was intentionally brought in for her dancing prowess. i would suggest she take more dance classes before venturing this path again. moving on to akshaye kanna, im not sure as to the link between his role and comical intent of the movie. his claim of donning a guest role in this movie is weak, he is present on screen through most of second half. this movie probably will do more damage to his acting career than fix it. the background scores and the songs are definitely not worth mentioning, half the numbers are remixes thus taking away the need for remix artists and djs. none of the songs are worth humming, even the sticky sheila ki jawani with its bad hinglish lyrics. the movie sports an occasional burst of a kid shouting tees maar khan, ruining the few laughs for your money. tmk is bad rip from a 1966 movie after the fox, which was a fun movie with character. tmks story line is like evoking laughter by beating below the belt. the script fails to build the lead actors character and hence does not muster any sort of harmony from the audience it fails to evoke any kind of sympathy for the lead role as the story line jumps from comical to scary and to serious. the transitions, being abrupt keep the audience guessing the genre of the movie through its length. half way through the movie the story line, actors, guest actors completely lose direction and wander in different direction. some sequences either have no bearing on the movie or lack the chaining required in storytelling. the director seems to have lost the purpose when it crosses the half way mark. many of the obvious realities have been over looked or abandoned to make room for mindless comedy which by the ways fails to make people laugh. a few takeaways from the movie, there are many ways to make the audience laugh this probably is the worst way. now that the benchmark for the worst, other would only need to just do incrementally better. this movie is a must watch to expand your scales for rating movies. i have expended time and money in watching this movie, i urge you to watch this movie to make me look less gullible.",positive
"troll 2 1990 is a movie in my dvd collection and is currently available on hulu. the storyline involves a family exchange of sorts where a family from the suburbs moves into a country town with hardly any residents and where once people go they stay. shortly after arriving in the countryside it becomes very apparent things are strange, food is scarce and people want them to drink milk. this movie is directed by claudio fragasso zombie 3 and stars michael paul stephenson beyond darkness, george hardy texas cotton, margo prey at gunpoint, connie young ice spiders, deborah reed the stand and robert ormsby. the storyline for this movie is actually pretty fun, unfolds well and is entertaining. the script is mediocre and the acting is worse, definitely below average. the movie opening and narration is great. theres a great use of settings and interesting circumstances throughout the movie. the horror scenes, makeup, costumes and masks are very well done and extremely entertaining. overall, this is an entertaining movie that isnt a masterpiece by any means, isnt particularly good but is extremely entertaining. id consider this a must see for horror fans and grade it a 510.",negative

"love, death robots is an anthology of animated sciencefiction shorts. a few stories use live actors but heavy use of animation in the whole. most of the animation is cg some might be handdrawn or might be really well stylized cg, im not sure. the animation itself is stunning. this is nextgen. there are a wide variety of styles on display, but its all great, as good as anything ive ever seen, and thats including the old masters. i mess about with 3d modelling, and the cg stuff is really breathtaking in the detail and in the bridge between style and realism. these are people who know their art. the stories themselves are very, very similar to those that youd find in the old days in heavy metal the movie or the magazine. that means gratuitous sex, gratuitous violence it means a certain aesthetic, focused on sciencefictioncool it means cleverness, occasional humor, and plenty of weirdness. i wouldnt have expected good stories from a movie like this, yet ldr mostly delivers on that front its narratives are well paced and enjoyable. maybe its main weakness assuming gratuitous sex and violence doesnt turn you off is its character writing. the characters may be modelled and animated nearly perfectly, but as characters theyre still pretty twodimensional. but im not sure how much anyone could expect from an anthology series on this front, and poor characterization is pretty much the rule in this genre. if youre a fan of science fiction or animation, and the sex and violence doesnt turn you off really, its just there for its own sake, although some of us think thats fine then i think ldr will blow you away.",positive
"death of a unicorn offers a fun, fresh, and almost nostalgic vibe, reminiscent of stumbling upon a cheesy creature feature on the syfy channel in the early 2000s. while the film has its fair share of flaws, the joyride it provides makes it easy to overlook them. lets start with the cast. none of the actors deliver performances that will have you scrambling for award nominations. by now, we know what to expect from a jenna ortegaled film, and here she fits that mold. paul rudd, who is always a delight, seems to have dialed it back a bit, offering a more subdued performance than usual. still, the true standout moments come from will poulter and anthony carrigan, whose lines are some of the most quotable in the film. that said, while the acting isnt remarkable, its not inherently bad either. the cast is likable enough to carry the films charm, even if they dont fully elevate the material. the films biggest issue, however, is pacing. despite a solid runtime of 1 hour and 44 minutes, death of a unicorn feels like a much longer experience. yet, surprisingly, i never found myself bored. the slow pacing is counterbalanced by the movies quirks the atrocious cgi unicorns, the occasionally underwhelming performances from capable actors, and the overall oddball tone. ultimately, what really makes death of a unicorn one of my favorite movies of the year so far is its fantastic writing. the script brings a surprising depth to its world, making the flaws easy to forgive and turning what couldve been a forgettable creature feature into something oddly endearing.",negative
"jaws the revenge is the final entry into the jaws series, and thank god for that. ellen brody is now living in the bahamas after her youngest son sean, who has followed in the footsteps of his father and become chief of the amity police, is killed by another great white shark. in what is the most ridiculous plots of all time, we find out that one specific shark is holding a grudge against the brody family, and after it kills sean, it swims against the gulf stream down to the bahamas so it can kill ellen and michael as well. jaws the revenge is an embarrassment to anyone who knows anything about sharks, and is the worst of the series. the plot is completely wrong in this movie. the whole plot is built off of bs. i cant even allow suspension of disbelief to let me ignore that the shark is hunting the brody family. its ridiculous! aside from that is that the film contains any number of factual errors about sharks ranging from having the shark swim backwards, roar like a lion, stand on its tail, and devour a helicopter. the shark in the first film did unusual things, but nothing that would make a shark lover cry. the acting in this movie is so bad that...you know what? i dont even want to discuss it. its bad. terrible. loathsome. repugnant. what else is there? lorraine gray played ellen just fine in the first film, but for some reason in this film she let all of her acting skill slip away. even michael caine, who is a vastly talented actor, shows absolutely no skill at all. every copy of jaws the revenge should be swallowed by the shark from the first film. 110",negative

"to many people bash this movie, and personally, i think it is one of the most faithful adaptations ive ever seen from anything to screen for this time period. the bad the red skulls look at the end of the movie wasnt really all that crappy... it just wasnt the red skull... i have to admit they did take their time to get where they were going in the middle of the movie. the good the good greatly outweighs the bad in this film. matt salinger does a perfect rendition of steve rogers captain america in his childish gee whiz kind of way. the red skulls make up in the first half of the film is breath taking, and scott paulin with a great assist from the script gives more character depth to the red skull than ive ever seen in the comics. the opening half hour rushes by with grace, ending with a fantastic battle inside a nazi stronghold, and the climatic battle between cap and the skull at the end is also unbelievable. and dont get me started on the pull over. i feel sick. parts of it. overall one of the best comic films out there, even after seeing some of todays, its the perfect adventure for the whole family!",positive
"the actors were incredible, the way they dove into their characters and managed to make them believable even though the characters were written to be too much and satirical. they are also what saved this movie, because, unfortunately, the plot was nothing more than mediocre. nothing surprising or out of the box, very linear in storytelling, most of the characters depth came from the acting and not from how they were written and built. but it is a movie that is fun to watch for an evening. while sitting in the cinema, you enjoy the atmosphere, the jokes, the too much approach and references to todays life. just dont expect a new approach on topics, genres or story.",positive

id honestly never heard of bo burnham before this popped up on netflix. i had absolutely no idea what this was going to be. the brief blurb suggested he was a comedian. so would this be a comedy? a movie? stand up? a documentary? ill tell you exactly what it is......a modern day masterpiece. its blown my mind. ive watched it 3 times now in the space of 3 days and even listened to the soundtrack on spotify. ive recommended it to anyone who will listen. i hope in years to come it will be looked back upon as an essential piece of art commentating on a very particular moment of time. incredible!!!,positive
"the film works for children, just like its predecessor, but it leaves little to be remembered, unlike the first one. the original moana was a visual result that oscillated between the beautiful and the sublime. from the beauty of the crystal clear ocean to the green colors of the island, the beauty of the universe was seen in a duel with the equally beautiful and captivating protagonist and due to the feeling of weight we feel on screen, the entire worldbuilding of the film perfected the journey and gave it a proven strong iconography, with memorable music and perhaps the best performance of the rocks career. the original moana captured a cultural element that for a long time was seen as taboo, such as tattoos, and made it central to its story with beautiful arguments and gave its film a purpose and respect for the minds of children, teenagers and adults, with other viable messages for everyone. this movie doesnt have that. at least not to the same extent. moana 2 is similar to a walk in the park to distract the little ones while the parents have some peace. this walk certainly shouldnt be a waste of time for them and probably not for the parents either, since there is enough movement, color, humor and music to disguise the lack of ideas. the film is concerned with following the model of contemporary animations in the speed and volume of jokes, action scenes and use of music inserted into the story in exchange for capturing your attention, instead of winning it over with a good narrative. the absence of clements and musker is palpable. its ok, but not memorable.",positive
"mickey 17 is a movie thats not bad but not always good. robert pattinson nails an american accent, which to be honest is totally unnecessary given the amount of different nationalities involved! british features strongly. but anyway he does well. and hes always great in the role of all mickeys. the supporting cast are fine except for in my opinion a terrible character in mark ruffalos kenneth mars and yes i know what he was going for. its just pretty bad. the story isnt bad, its decent enough for a sci fi movie. but it doesnt nail any political or social matters like parasite or okja, both of which are absolutely brilliant films. and therefore a straight sci fi actioner couldve been better here. although admittedly theres some pretty funny moments. i sound disappointed which is probably the right emotion. i was expecting something really good but this had too much of okja and snowpiercer type action and acting to be unique. i dont want bong joonho to become a parody of himself like wes anderson. i believe hes capable of much more. i have absolutely loved all of his past efforts even barking dogs never bite, which i think is hilarious. so thats 3 american made movies all very similar in tone. definitely time for something more. anyway its worth a watch but this is not a classic.",positive

"its original. its worth watching. not because its good. but its not bad! this is not very helpful... there is a parody here, but its too weak to be taken seriously. however there is something of an original story on death and its charms. comically its quite amusing, even if its not an lmao comedy. it is amusing most of the time. some of the time its quite forced, or over acted, or too over the top when it does not need to be. yet, that is the point and style of this movie so just embrace that it does a good job at not being perfect. where this movie really shines is being a conversational piece. remember back in the day before cellphones and we talked about movies all the time? i bet this one would have been one of the most talked about movies of the year. it has so many little pieces worth having a conversation about! but we dont live in those days anymore. reviews is about as close to a conversation as we get. so if i were to judge this as a movie id want to see again, id say no. im glad it was made, but it will not be mentioned again.",positive

"as a film, as a horror film and as a remake it is the worse. whether it falls in these three categories, the fog 2005 is an awful adaptation of the 1980 john carpentar classic. people complain about a nightmare on elm street, friday the 13th and even halloween being remade, but i think that this is the devil of all remakes. this remake has no originality and even if i heard bad things about this remake, like all films i gave it a chance. i did and as the first 10 minutes rolled in, i just wanted this piece of crap to end. ill talk through on what i think of the film. acting, 310 very poor and pretty useless and we can expect from modern horror films. the girl on the radio, elizabeth the smallville actor try their best but they dont save this film at all. aside from those actors acting terribly, the other actors do nothing to help and they are just plain and simple, with no character. storyplot, 010 what a messed up plot!? this plot doesnt work for me at all. in carpentars version it was all about a creepy ghost tale. it was about an evil atmosphere that would come on a certain night at a certain time after 100 years later. this remakes side of the story is very uninspiring. its about 4 crooks burning a boat which has men, women and children. after they return 1000 years later to get revenge. it sounds like the same thing but its that dysfunctional that i couldnt understand whats with that and this? scariness, 010 the film is not scary at all. from start to end it isnt creepy. if you want scares go rent the 1980 classic because the kills and the atmosphere is more tense. besides describing those things, i would like to describe the worse thing possible in the film that is unrealistic, overdone and not creepy whatsoever. the scenes of the fog. when the fog kills it is very unrealistic. when it kills, we see human hands grabbing people and we see that the fog has cleared. when the fog moves in and out of places it is done very quickly. it moves very fast and that gives us no tension or creeps whatsoever. every scene with the fog fails epically. its not scary and it never creeped me out. i just sat there and said yep, really scary. the fog in carpentars version is much more realistic because it moves in very slowly and that what gives it tension. and then when hands grab people, its like the hands are camouflaged through the fog to give off the nice effect. i didnt have hope for this film at the start and now i wish i had two hours of my life back because this version was very uninspiring. nothing is pulled off well here. nada.... even if carpentars the fog isnt my favorite horror film, i still think it beats the remake tremendously. 110",negative

"this film tells a story of rivalry between two toys a cowboy doll named woody and an action figure named buzz lightyear. they will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening woodys place as his favorite toy. a rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. directed by john lasseter, one of the brightest minds of pixar studios, the film features the voices of tom hanks as woody and tim allen as buzz for the main characters. this was the film that launched pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. the story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. this film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. its a great movie for the family and its still current today, twenty years after his premiere.",positive

"considering its many affiliations with american hustle noted in that films review, it is interesting to watch how in the former, the f.b.i. emerged as foolhardy in their undeniably wellmeaning approach while here they are treated more or less as the heroes of the day when their operation proves a resounding success! anyway, much has been said of this latest martin scorseseleonardo di caprio collaboration especially in how it treads the line of tastelessness for much of its 3 hour duration with some of the admittedly overthetop sexndrugs antics seeming to belong more in a grindhouse or even eurocult movie from the 1970s!. still, i feel this backlash especially for the way such serious offenses as depicted in the film are treated in blackly comic terms was itself extreme just note how much attention has been given to the dwarfthrowing gag the pros and cons of such a wild scheme are amusingly delineated just like any other businessrelated item! but, seeing how it occurs during the very opening scene, one would expect the viewer to have totally worked it out of his system by the time the pictures end credits start rolling! indeed, to scorseses credit, if the jordan belfort gangs scamming of both poor and rich people was dealt with so thoroughly or, should i say, the rewards they reaped from it these characters fall from grace is at least as detailed and spectacular so, in that respect, it comes off as a balanced evaluation of a particular lifestyle which, like it or not, exists and to which gullible people themselves contribute in a misguided attempt to increase their own bank account without having to work for it! as for di caprio, his performance is indeed among the years best and one of his own towering achievements but, personally, i feel he was even better in the aviator 2004 and shutter island 2010 for which he was not even oscarnominated!, both also for scorsese. the film under review is up for just five academy awards, which rather shuts it out from winning any of the top categories unless the ampas voters prefer the star to matthew mcconaughey in dallas buyers club another initially reprehensible reallife character dealing in illegal substances but, in his case, for the common good rather than selfgratification, which i sincerely doubt! incidentally, mcconaughey himself turns up here early on as the antiheros mentor and whose ritualistic hum to get him functioning on a daily basis is even worked into a song by the actor and the films music director robbie robertson exmember of the band and a scorsese regular! jonah hill as the protagonists sidekick is also shortlisted in the supporting actor category but, while his contribution is highly entertaining, there is little depth to the part even less so where their other colleagues are concerned, who somehow seem stuck in the lower rungs of the firm despite its obvious flourish!. di caprios role being based on the book written by belfort himself is clearly much more rounded, then, especially since his intermittent narration is adamant that money and power even more so when acquired at a young age and unlawfully too often lead one on a selfdestructive path and the fact that he was able to rise again after doing time is a testament to his talent for survival, if nothing else! to go back to its ties with american hustle, the f.b.i. sequences necessarily recall those of scorseses earlier and superior goodfellas 1990 which suggests that its best and funniest moments tend to involve the aftereffects of the copious intake of drugs, notably dicaprio getting tonguetied during a vital telephone call and his spastic attempts to reach his luxurious car and drive back home. for the record, film director rob reiner appears as di caprios colourful dad and jean dujardin is a swiss bank manager to where the countless millions are literally transferred out of the federal authorities reach. on a personal note, i should say that i was expecting to hate this going in but i have had to eat my words and admit that it was an enjoyable if no pun intended taxing ride...which, as soon as it was over, made me run to the medicine cabinet and pop a headache pill myself!",positive
"how in the hell do you mess up a parody of twilight? the twilight movies are so terrible that all you have to do to parody them successfully is slightly exaggerate the already annoying and ridiculous melodrama inherent in the series. i mean... for fs sake! a random kid on youtube has done it successfully, and hes done it more successfully than this studio approved movie with no budget! but, surprise, surprise the geniuses who brought us date movie, epic movie, meet the spartans, and disaster movie have once again failed to grasp even the basic elements of comedy in this piece of s. its like they actively tried to write the movie so that it wouldnt be funny at all. the... film... loosely follows the story of the first two twilight movies. to their credit, its clear that they actually sat through the movies and were attempting to parody some parts of the film. i recognized scenes from new moon, like bella being followed by a ghost of edward on a motorcycle, and the staring out the window scene passing from month to month, but they failed to do anything that was actually funny with it. rather than come up with some clever jokes, or funny stuff for edward to say while hes chasing bella on the motorcycle, he just keeps falling down. thats not funny. there was a joke with a guy in a wheelchair where he talks about how he cant feel anything from his waist down, and feels the need to emphasize that his genitals are down there. thats not funny. it wouldve been funny if it was clever innuendo, but they have to beat you over the head with the joke. there are three big problems with the humor of this movie. the first is pratfalls. there are a ton of body injury jokes in this movie. and none of them work. part of that it is because they use it too often, but the other part of that is that they dont do anything clever or interesting with the injury jokes. people are thrown into walls. people trip and fall. a guy gets thrown into a piano. but the actors dont do anything with it. there are no jokes written for the fall. they just expect us to laugh because someone fell down. its not just funny because someone falls. you need character reaction, you need a set up, you need a d joke! the second problem is reference. this is the same problem the more recent episodes of family guy have. these guys throw in a reference to jersey shore here, a reference to tiger woods there, but theres no actual joke. again, they just expect us to laugh because its there. hey, i recognize jersey shore! thats funny! no its not! its not funny! you need to do something with the reference to make it funny! you cant just say the name of a tv show or give a pop culture reference and expect us to think its funny just because we recognize it! you have to write a joke to go with it!!! the third problem is juvenile humor. does just hearing the word penis make anyone laugh over the age of 15? they have a lot of jokes in here i might have found funny when i was 10, but theyre not funny to more mature people. heck, even most of the kids in the audience werent laughing at it, because they probably saw some of their classmates doing it better on youtube! overall this movie is terrible. when there are jokes, they dont work. most of the jokes are just references or pratfalls, and when they actually find something that has the potential to be funny, they dwell on it so long that it just gets tedious. i saw this movie the same way i saw new moon because it was a slow night at the drivein where i work... and i gotta say, im glad ive never seen any of their films before, and i dont intend to watch another. 110 im not recommending this to anyone. its worse than twilight. at least the makers of twilight put some effort into it to make it entertaining for the fans.",negative

"ive never seen stuff from fielder before, i just went into this show after hearing some positive buzz and i liked the concept. what i first and foremost love about this is that yeah, it definitely is a comedy, but its dry, so dry that it could go over your head. i love it though and there are so many jokes, moments and how they frame things that work perfectly. fielder is great as well as this monotonous lump of meat who gives the funniest responses and it imo at master at dry humor. nathan for you is on my watchlist for sure. special shoutout to the fake version actors of the real individuals, they were so good it was incredible casting and method acting. it really sold the rehearsal sections in both comedy and excellence. the reality section of the show is where i sometimes have issues. i think it works most of the time but at other times i just have a really hard time not noticing that there is an entire production team behind that camera and that what look like real moments just seem fake. the pilot worked really well for me, but especially the whole childhood storyline felt hard to believe at times. i do have to say the last two episodes and the emotional twist was incredible. it might be framed as a comedy but theres no lack of drama either. for it to be a called a documentary i find it just a little too slick and not entirely genuine at times, even if it wasnt actually. there rehearsals that include a doover with fielder pretending to be another person talking to a fake fielder rarely worked for me. because they were unbelievable to begin with, so then i took it that those segments are just for comedy. they get it right in the finale but like the one with the acting class wasnt good. music is pretty great too, the show really does have a strong underlying emotional and human subtext and the music excels to reveal that. this show if you let it can really pull at your heartstrings. especially the 2 final episodes. the religious angle towards the end...eh. i thought the conflict was great. i dont have anything against any religion. but it goes against my personal values of letting religion be a choice first and foremost instead of indoctrinated at an early age by sending your kids to religious schools and not showing alternativesgiving choices. then again, religion is not part of my identity, this is different for others, so i get it. all in all great show, but certainly not for everyone. if you dont see the humor then it will get boring real fast. looking forward to season 2 whatever that may bring.",positive
"i am certainly in the minority but this movie just dumped all of the 902000s pop culture in to the death pit. people who have actually seen 300 can enjoy it to the fullest! plus if they have enough knowledge of the references that has been brought in the mix with ancient greece. its 2018 and i have watched it again! it certainly stood out to be one of the best parodies of all times, imo besides scary movie series. p.s carmen electra is drop dead hot!",negative

"i saw this classic when i was a kid and i loved it until this day. when i heard chuck jones did it, i was surprised because of the animation and style looked similar to his bugs bunny, coyote and roadrunner and tom and jerry cartoons. however, i got more surprised when i heard that boris karloff not only voiced the grinch, but narrated it very well. my love grew stronger because back then, when i was a teenager, i was starting to fall into the field of classic horror films. i knew boris karloff played the frankenstein monster and imhotep the mummy. he had this calm british voice. as for the songs, well they are as timeless as the special itself! albert hague made the music to it and i was surprised that he was the music teacher in the original fame. my favorite song is youre a mean one mr. grinch because when you hear it you cant stop and think of all those disgusting things that come to our mind when we hear the song. forget about ron howards adaptation with jim carrey because that one is complete and utter garbage catered for those who watch wacky cartoons on such cable channels as nickelodeon and cartoon network. bottom line this animated special is timeless and it must be watched for new generations of audiences.",positive
"this has got to be one of the worst fillums ive ever seen and ive seen a few. it is slow, boring, amateurish not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot. the actors do not act. i cant blame them they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersisle. there is not one moment in this film that rings true not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved. the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations. i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.",positive
"this is a very bad filmtheres no denying this. imagine having a young arnold schwarzenegger whose command of english was much worse than when he did his movies in the 1980s playing a greek god who comes to new york for a few laughs! now the concept could have actually workedif the leading man hadnt been barely cognizant of the english language. and, had the writers not been chimpanzees, the story could have been turned into a cute little tongueincheek tale. but, in the end, through total incompetence, its a dreadful movie. but, for people who like watching stupid films and laughing at them, then they are in for a treat with hercules in new york! the film begins in a very minimalistic mount olympian headquarters for the gods. including the cost of the pillars, i think the set was created for about 47.50. well, in this sketchy looking layout, the gods are all standing around when hercules announces hes bored and wants to go back to earth. zeus forbids him and they argue. ultimately, zeus tosses him out of the sky onto the earth and from here on hercules has a lot of adventures. for the most part, schwarzenegger plays the role like hes a lovable moron...goofy and looking a bit like jethro bodine when he first went to the big city! among the exciting? adventures he has are various wrasslin matches, fighting an escaped bear a guy in one of the worst bear suits ive ever seen and hanging out with arnold stanga man who has somehow learned to talk entirely through his nose. id tell you more about the story, but really dont think its all that important. suffice to say, jethro runs around new york often with no shirt and gets into wacky trouble. as far as the research for the writers goes, i think theyd have been better off if theyd read a few comic books or asked the average high school student for advice. when it comes to knowing even the basic information about the greek gods, they often got is completely wrongmixing greek and roman names for the gods again and again for example, juno, venus and hercules are roman names and zeus and nemesis are greek as well as having little understanding or care about the gods themselves mercury was not hercules brother, pluto was not the devil nor did he live in hell, etc., etc.. in addition, at the end of the film, samson from the old testament and atlas whose job it is to hold the earth come to the rescue! there are also two versions of this film. traditionally, the version most have seen has a dubbed voice for arnold, as hes occasionally barely comprehensible. but, this is also really silly as the voice is very robotic and obviously not his. this is the case with the version posted on imdb though, oddly, this version also lacks music and many basic sound effects. for those wanting to see and hear arnold, the dvd has the original restored voicebut wont give you the option to hear either one. additionally, at the end, when he talks to stang from the radio, its not arnolds voice but that of the robotdude. overall, the film was a shoddy and silly mess. but there was a certain goofiness that make it fun to watch despite its many, many obvious shortcomings. not a good film at all, but fun to watch if you need a laugh.",negative
"im a fan of the bloodrayne video game series and this is the only reason i went to watch the movie, that and kristanna loken of course. i feel sad giving this movie a 1 because in reality it deserves a complete zero!! i already knew this movie was going to be bad because uwe boll, the director has completely annihilated all the horrorbased videogames to movie conversions out there, house of the dead alone in the dark are proof of this testament. the thing that shocked me was that this movie was actually worse than both of those movies combined!!! the movie follows the games plot but he executes it very poorly. kristanna loken who plays the role of bloodrayne is suppose to have a blade like personality but instead shes just another terminator. on top of that, the action scenes look like they were choreographed by a blind man with brain damage ill leave that to your imagination. bloodrayne is supposed to have a very gothic atmosphere but instead uwe boll decides to set the atmosphere at a trickortreat level. by the time i was done watching this movie, i realized that my eyes bled. do yourself a favor and save yourself from torture by avoiding this movie at all costs.",negative

"first off, let me say that i did rather enjoy this film. yes, it is a rather read very farfetched premise. and yes, it does have some massive plot holes mainly because it completely disregards the spacetime continuum. but this film is not designed to have you focus on these things. it is only after viewing that you realise just how stupid the whole thing is and where all the problems with timelines etc, etc lie. yet, i still found myself wanting to see it again. the main characters play their parts very well. all the actors must have known exactly what they were getting themselves into and they are all willing participants. i did especially enjoy rob corddrys part as a washed up, dead end, dead beat alcoholic. his character was the fulcrum for the majority of the humour, both situational and verbal. craig robinson bought the lighthearted humour, as well as some of the best punch lines of the film. john cusack played the serious dramaticcomedic role and clark duke has his moments while helping to aim the whole package toward a younger demographic. even the secondary characters have their moments of comedy glory. there are genuine laugh out loud moments spread pretty evenly throughout which are based on plot and character, not just grossout humour. and although grossout humour is present it sits well because the film doesnt rely on it alone to deliver the laughs. another thing i found very entertaining about this movie was that as the characters travelled back to the 80s it was almost as if the humour did too. i dont mean to say that things descended into a porkies revisited or anything like that, but there were definite elements of the 80s present in the way the humour and characters come across. think back to scenes you remember off the top of your head from back to the future, caddy shack, ferris buellers day off, hell even breakfast club. hot tub time machine just seemed to capture some of that and revive it for todays audiences. i would recommend httm to anyone with a sense of humour not wanting to think too deeply and wanting to be entertained for 90 minutes. like i said at the top of this review... there are plot holes. there is no recognition of the spacetime continuum actually, the future repercussions of the characters actions would have never worked out like they do. and, really, at no point does the film actually make sense. but... i was still entertained. i still laughed. i still wanted to see where the characters went. i still find myself remembering lines from the film and smiling. and, even after all ive just written, id still watch it again. cant say more than that now, can i?",positive

"oh dear, this was bad! the 2010 remake of the old piranha movie was bad, but this sequel to that 2010 remake, are you kidding me? where to begin? well lets start with piranha trashing a wooden pier to get to the people on top of it? so fish are able to selectively single out prey and take down the barriers they are on? or what about piranha jumping out of the water and onto the shore in order to get to their prey? piranha starting to walk on land? piranha jumping up and in one bite decapitate a grown man, then later on do the same to a boy? or a piranha swimming up inside a woman through her private parts and living inside her womb? or what about the total rip off scenes from the 2010 version? a piranha biting off a mans private parts? or having a formerly wellknown actor garey busey have a cameo role in the beginning of the movie only to die within minutes? can you say this also happened in part one? or a sheriff ving rhames having lost both his legs in the first movie and now back with two steel legs, one of which is also a shotgun. or how about david hasselhoff playing himself and making an ass of his previous roles and personality? this movie was so lame, words dont even begin to describe it. so why watch it? well, simply because it is such a cheesy spoof on itself and the 2010 version. it was hard to take this movie serious at all. the storyline is downright insulting to your intelligence, but still it is worth watching because it is so predictable, so cheesy and so stupid. and it is worth to watch because of the blood and gore, and because you will be laughing at the absurdity of the entire movie. the entire movie seems like to be directed by a horny teenager for an audience of horny teenagers. there is an excessive amount of nudity, sexual situations and women in little or no clothing at all. so you should take that into consideration before watching the movie, if you are easily offended by such material or situations. and why did a decapitated head have to land right between a womans enormous breasts? that was so stupid on so many levels. having seen the 2010 remake and not overly impressed with it, then it was with some hesitation that i sat down to watch this 2012 sequel. why? well because i had the movie at hand and had the time to spare. having seen it now, i can say that they managed to make the piranha story worse than it already was. it was hard to find the bright moments in this movie. but i suppose if you are a teenage boy, this might be right up your alley. senseless entertainment with blood and a lack of coherent storyline.",negative
"the first time i saw the movie was when i was about seventeen or so, and i never forgot it. the incredibly human characters such as the doctor who loved riddles, the fantastic scriptwriting, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. this movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. there is so much love in the characters doras love for her husband guido is boundless, as well as guidos love for his son. sure, its a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, arent they all a little unrealistic? ive also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. i dont think so i think that its only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. i would say that those who think this movie is too light are cynical and bitter. the whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. this movie changed my life from the first time i watched it. i came away with this feeling that no matter what i have to face in life, that i can overcome it. this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. the acting is superb though roberto benigni is a little overthetop, lol, the story heartwarming and easy to understand. its excellent!",positive
"one piece is an amazing series. it has great and just the right amount of adventure, action, comedy and drama. a little warning is that it will start off slow compared to most anime you may watch but after the characters are done with their first goal the show finally starts pacing up. ill be honest, i came into the show with really low expectations. i didnt think it would be worth my time or a stupid story. but after it started and i was done with the first episode i was speechless. the way the show is headed is the thing that grabs your interest. i think that was one of the reasons i like it so much right now. one of the greatest things about this show is that the concept and story might seem unoriginal or easy to just sum up in a season. but the show expands that entire journey theyre on in such a huge way you honestly couldnt imagine by just reading this. when it comes to characters youll love them or just not hate them at least. the creator has a nice way of not trying to rub them on the screen and get them on your nerves. if this is your first anime then thats great. itll be a fun start to a long journey. if your a naruto fan or dragon ball fan then youll feel the same experience you had watching them. pretty much everybody whos told me the show didnt really entertain them were people who just watch any random episode which ill be honest, you wont understand a thing if you watch something in the middle of the arcseason. but this series all together shares a great lesson and thats if you never give up youll accomplish your dreams, even if it cost you a lot in your life, always fight for what you want to do. this is my review for one piece.",negative

"i am going to do my best and keep my comments to a more analytical level instead of just bashing it for its ineptitude oops. film starts out in texas where kelly kelly clarkson is a waitress in a bar and her friends alexa katherine bailess and kaya anika noni rose talk her into going to spring break in fort lauderdale, florida. when they get there they bump into three boys who are there to set up contests on the beach for a profit. justin justin guarini meets kelly and the two are instantly attracted to one another but alexa is jealous of her and gives justin her own cell phone number instead of kellys so that she can sabotage their dates. meanwhile, kaya meets a dishwasher named carlo jason yribar and they go out dancing one night but the next day she yells at his boss and gets carlo fired. this film was directed by robert iscove and hes actually a pretty competent television director which is appropriate because this film plays like a badly written sitcom. the story is more or less an updated version of the beach comedies starring frankie and annette but in those films they at least tried to do some things differently. this film plays it extremely safe to the point where everything you think will happen does. there is absolutely no surprises that take place. clarkson and guarini do theyre own singing and clarkson actually has a good voice so i do give them credit for that but unfortunately the songs are of the american idol variety. they dont sound contemporary and are very cheesy but so is everything about this film. if you hate the songs then youll despise the dancing. justin and kelly are decent singers but they are just not dancers by anyones definition. the numbers appear clumsily choreographed and many of the performers do not dance in the same step or rhythm. very lightweight script makes fraternity vacation seem like the caine mutiny and its evident that this was written very quickly to try and cash in on the success of american idol. one of the producers is the one and only simon fuller who created the television series and he underestimated the intelligence of the people who actually pay money to view something.",negative

"i personally have no real problem with 3d, as long as it is done well and has a good story and characters. sadly, thats where the adventures of sharkboy and lava girl fails. i like robert rodriguez and thought his first two spy kids movies were very enjoyable and while mediocre i actually thought the third spy kids film was better than this too. i will give some credit, the moral is decent if hardly original and there is some energy. but everything else falls flat. people might say the art direction was colourful and pleasing to the eye. sorry, for me it was very tacky, gaudy and brash. and as for the 3d, it is actually some of the worst ive seen, it needed more clarity and sharpness and sometimes moved too fast. also i found it distracting in alternative to enhancing. the soundtrack is rather plodding, generic and unmemorable too. the script is absolutely awful too. any parts that tried to be funny made me roll my eyes to be perfectly honest with you, while the story is unevenly paced and very weak and predictable. the characters are just as weak and bland too, the two main characters have their likable moments but there is little chemistry between them and the audience while the supporting characters fare even worse suffering either from being underused or overacted. overall, the acting is very uneven and way too broad in some cases. other disappointments are the poor pace and plodding direction from rodriguez. so in conclusion, the result is a pretty awful, overstuffed and disappointing effort of a family film. 110 bethany cox",negative

"back in the early nineties i rented this abomination at a mompop video rental store. after about thirty minutes i stopped my vcr in utter disgust, rewound it, and never looked back. fast forward almost twenty years and i stumble upon troll 2 latenight on mgm hd channel. by the way, this channel is golden as far as showing terrible films in stunning 1080i no less. after sitting through this in its entirety im assured that i did the right thing those many years ago. troll 2 is just that bad. directed by italian hackmaster claudio fragasso, the real reason zombie 3 sucks, here hiding behind the name drago floyd. the waits family is participating in some bizarre hometown swap with some residents from the town of nilbog, much to the chagrin of youngest son joshua who delivers his lines with a facial grimace reserved for dire situations in a gas station bathroom when you have an upset stomach. recently deceased grandpa seth assist joshua from the beyond in keeping his family from being eaten from vegetarian goblins who instead of i dont know eating plants! have to get the humans to eat this disgusting green concoction that turns them into human trees to be consumed by the townsfolks, er trolls, i mean goblins. the goblins are controlled by their queen creedence leonore gielgud who adds the ham to this cheese sandwich by using the same eyes widening schtick for every line she speaks. joshua runs the gamut from urinating on dinner to assault with a bologna sandwich to save his family who are constantly hoodwinked into consuming the food covered in green icing that no sane person would even think of eating. the fact that they never question anything in this bizarre town is whats so frustrating about this movie. this film is definitely on par with ed woods plan 9 as far as worse acting performances ever. joshuas mother diana has the same clueless look on her face the whole friggin film and doesnt say one thing thats even remotely convincing. michael waits probably delivers one of the dumbest lines and probably most overlooked of this film as he explains to joshua why the town is so empty in the middle of the day as a the farmers are all asleep this time of night. huh? one, its mid afternoon. two, what sort of farmer farms at night. vampire farmers? good god who wrote this! which brings me to the worst of the worst. holly waits is the single most maddeningly awful character you will ever watch. its downright vile how she spits her lines with this uberbratty personality and her constant over emphasis on the wrong syllable. her bizarre solo dance scene showcases that shes just as bad a dancer as an actress. there are some bad films that provide genuine enjoyment such as , for me at least, r.o.t.o.r., which is why the bottom 100 is such as popular list. this film is not one of those as there is no hint of charm whatsoever. avoid this movie at all cost.",negative

"it would be easy to view this movie as simply another wretched entry in the recent spate of video gamehorror movies. however, director uwe boll has brilliantly deconstructed this genre and cloaked it in the guise of alone in the dark. the first 34 of the movie is devoted to setting up the conventions of the genre invisible monsters, secret government organizations, the lone wolf investigator brilliantly underplayed by christian slater, the implausibly attractive assistant tara reid at her most selfaware. the setup, akin to sondheims into the woods, establishes conventions which the second part of the movie gleefully deconstructs. the last quarter of the movie turns all previous convention on its head, willfully ignoring its own rules and exposing the entire genre as the mindless pablum that it is all while confusing the audience to such a degree that we are left with no alternative but to reject the overt meaning entirely and grasp at the underlying substance which, as boll masterfully renders, is nothing. he even taunts the audience with clues as to his actual intent reids obviously intentional mispronunciations, climactic fights which end with nonexploding grenades, stephen dorffs entire performance. the simultaneous constructiondeconstruction of the movie could be accomplished by no one save an artist on the level of dali, which boll undoubtedly is. ten out of ten.",negative

"everytime i walk out of a movie theater, no matter what movie i had just seen, i always think to myself, this was no troll 2... no movie since has been made that has left such an impact on me as a serious film critic. why is this movie so great? unlike 99 of movies out today, troll 2 accomplishes something most movies dont even come close to and usually fail at, its entertaining. this movie has no relation to the original troll and that is a good thing. the reason it was named troll 2 is a mystery much like how tarantinos movie, reservior dogs, has everyone guessing why it was named as that. unfortunately, the director, joe damato, has taken that secret to the grave with him. the plot, every scene, every bit of dialouge, the acting, the costume and makeup, the music especially the opening credits classic, and every little detail of this movie captures your attention leaving you in awe from beginning to end. the movie is about a family who decides to go on a vacation in the small town of nilbog despite protest from joshua, the young son and hero of the movie, who was warned from his deceased grandfather about cruel deformed forest dwellers who live in nilbog. as with most parents of the babyboomer generation, joshuas pleads are not only ignored, but mocked and ridiculed. the family, needless to say, goes on with the planned schedule and the adventure begins. one might criticize the casting of this movie. id rather have regular people in this movie, regular people meaning the demeaning term used by arrogant movie star celebrities which refer to us, the people who arent movie star celebrities, as this cast in troll 2 has more personality than any overpaid, silicone enhanced, plastic surgery addicted, tabliod covering, tanning salon using, church of scientologist following, teen movie drama appearing, actor out there. watching the cast is memorizing, especially how they react to the goblin threat. i could go on forever about this movie, i apologize for the rambling. go and see this movie, find it, rent it, you will be introduced to a whole new experience you probably have never have had. until troll 1.5 or troll 3, im going to defend troll 2 as a true unique movie experience unlike anything else. groundbreaking filmaking...troll 2...cue the goblin music!",negative
"i have absolutely no idea why i suddenly stopped watching the office us after season one......but almost 15 years later, thanks to the current uk lockdown i started again and ive finally finished the journey from season 1 to 9 and the whole series is complete! rewind quickly to 2005, living in the uk and having grown up with the original office somewhat of a british institution i remember i was incredibly sceptical of the plans to develop a u.s version and i have to admit that the first season, especially the first few episodes failed to deliver on some of the intended levels and i gave up on what felt like a poor mans david brent via steve carell. what a bad decision that was......michael scott is no david brent and now im 7 years late to the party. fast forward to 2020 and for whatever reason i started again with some ultimate tv binging. yes the first episodes decision to imitate the uk version and characters was a mistake but thankfully it seems noone realised that more than the producers and writers so stick with it! in fact whoever decided to quickly change the tone and concentrate on the character development deserves some serious credit! from that point on the office us becomes its own story and an utter masterpiece in telling that story whilst taking you on the ultimate journey of emotions with some amazing payoffs! none less than the finale that truly does set the bar for finishing a show! bravo!! comedy, intelligence, redemption, romance and heartbreak..... it literally has it all and then some. what a series, definitely one of the best ever and probably the best ever!",positive

"alright, mac and me was a lame attempt to recreate e.t. in some form and fashion, but for crying out loud, i could name a hundred movies that merit a place on imdbs worst 100 movies list, and this sure as hell aint one of them. i mean, in the first place, its a kids movie. filmmakers are entitled to some corniness and take advantage of some branding where they or the studio executives lack the drive for creativity. if nothing else, this is a horribly embarrassing time capsule artillery of 80s cheesiness. and i have to wonder why filmmakers assumed the easiest way to relate to kids interest was with some dorky streety dance scenes? this one is the story of a family of newcomers to california where there just happens to be a stranded alien baby or whatever you want to call it who strays from his alien family which are transported to earth after being sucked up by a nasa satellite. the baby befriends the youngest son. as it was in e.t., the boy tries to convince only those he trusts most his brother and the neighboring siblings of the aliens existence and help return the thing to its family. look for john ward as the older brother hubba! hubba! and a supercheesy slice of sentimental in the finale. kids might like it. apparently not too many others do.",negative

"amelie marries childlike wonder and artistic expression. its only consistent criticism is that the film is too whimsical, optimistic, or clean. however, these qualities are ideal for its theme of finding magic in the smallest aspects of everyday life. the plot may be playful, but its grounded by tragic backstories. there is an impenetrable innocence in amelie and its protagonist, but that merely coats an undertone of sadness. deep down, amelie is lonely and strives to make others happy to find her own fulfillment. therefore, when amelie is closely examined, it is actually quite bittersweet and her journey towards selfcare is rather cathartic. meanwhile, the craft of amelie is triumphant. its regional music sets a perfect mood, the special effects are surreal yet measured, and the production has a distinct color scheme. amelies editing is mellow with bursts of flashy techniques such as match cuts and montages. the sound design is magnified, highlighting the films imaginative nature. finally, the cinematography is divine. color, movement, shot variety, and composition are utilized beautifully, creating living art and intuitive storytelling. visually, amelie is deeply emotional because its images are so exact. overall, it is clear why jeanpierre jeunets masterpiece is universally loved. writing 1010 direction 1010 cinematography 1010 acting 910 editing 1010 sound 1010 scoresoundtrack 1010 production design 910 casting 810 effects 910 overall score 9.510.",positive

"this show really is outstanding, in fact its the only show i think i can rate as a 10. from watching the original uk series back in 2001 on bbc tv, i never thought an american remake would stand any ground whatsoever. when the first series aired in the uk it didnt really make its mark, and unfortunately never caught on. i was disappointed when it disappeared from our screens, and then quickly forgot about it. i thought it had 1 series and crashed and burned. then one day i was checking out the reviews for evan almighty on imdb and noticed that steve carel had still been making this show. i had to get hold of it and see it, and to my joy there was 5 series waiting for me. i never get into tv like i have done with this, i ended up watching 10 episodes in a day, i think i did all 5 series in just under 2 weeks. this show is funny, its acted brilliantly, its over the top, totally crazy but totally entertaining. if your ever down just bung on a couple episodes from good old dunder miflin in scranton and you cant go wrong. gervais said that 2 series of the office in the uk was enough. and that he didnt want to take it further. i know he helps on the us version, and i sure he is surprised to see 6 series already of what i can only describe as the best american sitcom of all time!!",positive

"upon first viewing the pilot episode of its always sunny, i was unsure of what to think. as i watched more, it grew on me. this enforces the point of the show truly being an original show. this show was uniquely created, straying far from the path of generic and repetitive comedies that are being aired, and aired again on various standard networking channels. as i stated, it took time to get me hooked, only because it was unlike anything i have seen on television, thus i needed more time to adapt to the humor. its always sunny has great characters that really engulf you in their charismatic, oddly charming, and awkward ways. the humor itself ranges from awkward silly humor, and all the way to dry situational comedic antics. needless to say, it has a vast supply of fresh material, suiting many comedic influences. the characters are a remarkable sight, the outgoing nature and chemistry between the cast allow for a more authentic situation feel. although the situations may be extravagant, or off the wall, it still feels like one can relate to the emotions and actions of the characters. the premise of the show itself isnt necessary brand spanking new, but once again, the antics of the characters are so unique it will leave you laughing at the sincerity of the actors expressions and actions. all the characters have their strengths, and i must say again, the sincerity and depth of the situations that the characters are put through are very humorous. charlie charlie day being one of the most unique characters, brings a lot to the table. his crazy endeavors, which he frequently pulls the rest of the cast into, are far from normal. he seems like the genuinely misunderstood character because of the incredibly awkward and strange situations he is in. eg. rat bashing, climbing in sewers, crazy ideas, inventions, etc dennis and mac are great characters as well, along with dee and frank, they all have great chemistry. it is honestly a great, fresh show, and you will have no idea what will happen to the gang in upcoming episodes. the episodes are like a freeforall, as i said, anything can happen to the gang. you can rely on the fact that things will get of hand, and the thingssituations will be dealt with in a offcolour way. it really is a fabulous show, and is definitely recommended as a somewhat lighthearted comedy. by this i mean it is the kind of show that really gives you the warming laughter, sometimes hysterical laughter, that you could just click on at any moment, and just have a good time.",positive

"season one of the bear is an anxious, grieffilled joy ride of intensity. jeremy allen white is a dynamic lead character as carmy berzatto, a michelin star chef who left his restaurant role to try and save the family business in chicago. ayo edebiri syd the remainder of this cast create a powerfully diverse ensemble in attitudes, generations and skill sets. in season one we watched carmy and syd save the beef from likely failure, however we conclude with their desire to open an entirely new restaurant the bear. season two kicks off hot on the ticking clock, 12 weeks to open the bear remain and uncle jimmy, who continues to foot the bills, is tired of waiting. rather than dominating with kitchen scenes full of chaos as season one did, season two of the bear embarks on a new ambitious journey one built around delving into the lives of its incredible ensemble cast. characters like cousin richie, tina marcus are given rewarding growth journeys provided by carmy syd to learn to operate on their level. carmy is given an authentic story of growth, made realer by his relapses in selfconfidence and belief. syd experiences her own journey of growth and seems to continue crumbling under her own expectations of herself, but edebiri plays this role with such comedic timing and delivery, adding great one liners and injecting comedy alongside fak and several others. the cameos are delightful, powerful and build the credibility of every side character. these cameo characters are instrumental to the journeys of each of the bears staff. its a wickedly stacked cast beyond the already impressive original ensemble. i love this show so damn much. it feels like youre watching a manifestation of grief. you can feel the palpable tension in every episode. the anxiety is driven to a high level with purpose. the bear engrosses you in a world of normal yet hurt people who arent satisfied continue to fight for their own growth.",positive

"it was precisely a refreshing movie , something new, something unexpectedat least in the beginning. i dont have much to say about the acting and the direction as i found it to be good, i am not completely moved by the characters but it was a good watching them unravel in their own essence. the bond between the mother and the daughter stayed with me the most, the way a mother helps her daughter sort her life even after her death was a very good concept. the concept of cds and the in the chase of inheritance the daughter ends up figuring out her whole life which was beautiful. i found it to be very predictable , but anyone who watches this movie would surely enjoy the process of it. it makes you want to have a family like what alexandra caroline rose had, i would say she was really lucky to have them by her side always and she also gradually figured out their importance in the movie. i liked how the brother and sister bond was shown, how they actually communicated through their emotions and how it was shown that just because your brother doesnt say anything or acts indifferent is not because he dislikes you but he might have his own insecurities or envies. i liked the character of alexandra who was fearless, bold and yet coy and was proudly a mess. overall its a good watch, one must definitely watch it to lighten up their mood. i watched it with my mom, you should watch it with your beloved ones too.",positive
"finalverdict the prechristmas week has at last shown up. the best is always reserved for the last and it has been a custom to have at least one biggie unfurl in the christmas week before the curtains fall on the ongoing year. salman khan teams up with the hit machine director prabhudheva yet again. in addition, several enviable names, on and offscreen, lend muscle to the enterprise. the canvas is gigantic as well. it cant get bigger than dabangg 3, honestly. prabhudheva is synonymous with audiencefriendly movies. most critics may abhor his work, however, the paying public the ones who matter ultimately adores his film. his films may not offer groundbreaking stuff, nor do they get exemplary honours, yet he whips up a storm at the boxoffice each time he attempts a highonentertainment fare. this is for fans and adversaries of salman khan... fans, cheer, salman is back furiously with dabangg 3. this is his deadliest performance to date. indeed, you read it right! adversaries, sorry, you wont have the option to lash out at him or dispatch a horrendous tirade this time. well, without mincing my words, i must avow that dabangg 3 is aimed exclusively at the hoi polloi. it rides on salman khans star power. in a film like dabangg 3, in a role that appears to be an expansion of his character, you cant even consider any other actor portraying this role with flourish. recollect the successful potboilers of yore. recall how the hero would diminish 10 goons to mash in a fraction of seconds. recall how heroism won at last, regardless of how unfriendly the conditions were. recall those films wherein rationale assumed a lower priority since the attention was on entertainment... you relive those moments as dabangg 3 unfolds. it maymay not make sense to you, but screenplay writers salman khan, prabhudheva and aloke upadhyaya ensure that you are entertained. with dabangg 3, one is well prepared about whats in store. the sole factor that director prabhudheva needs to stress over is whether dabangg 3 would meet the towering and monumental expectations. more so, because salman khan is contending with himself. salman khan has redefined superstardom with mass entertainers. hes boxoffices favourite actor and seems invincible and insurmountable at the moment! hardcore masala films are relished with glee by the audience and dabangg 3 takes this genre one step ahead. sure, its an old wine packed in a brand new bottle but the result is sheer magic. most importantly, dabangg 3 has salman khan like never before. in fact, breathing fire and venom, chulbul pandey aka robinhood pandey taps salmans star power like no film has. dabangg 3 stands on three pillars salman khans star power, smashing stunts and super music. in a nutshell, dabangg 3 delivers what it promises entertainment in enormous doses. prabhudhevas latest offering speaks the language that the masses comprehend. its one formula that can never go out of fashion if handled smartly. actually, chulbul pandey has come to represent the common man and thats yet another reason why you root for him, feel overjoyed and ecstatic when he triumphs in the finale. for anyone who needs to comprehend what is the onscreen meaning of bollywood, dabangg 3 is absolutely textbook fare. lets face it, dabangg 3 has nothing groundbreaking to offer as far as the story salman khan is concerned. but what makes dabangg 3 shine, and shine brightly, is salman khans star power, which camouflages the aberrations wonderfully. the film is special for two more reasons anl arasus stunts and sajidwajids music. talking of action scenes, salmans introduction at the start and the fighttofinish in the climax, when salmans shirt tears apart and the rippling muscles and the barechest fight ensues, will send the masses in frenzy. to state that the action scenes are outstanding, especially the fight in the finale would be an understatement. mark my words, the action scenes will lead to chaos at massdominated centres, especially at single screens. it wont be erroneous to state that the climax is worth the price of the ticket, samosa, sandwich, popcorn, nachos and cola put together. sajidwajids music is of a mixed variety and gels wonderfully with the genre of the film. munna badnaam hua track will send the viewers into raptures. the background score sandeep shirodkar is electrifying and in sync with the onscreen situations. dialogue dilip shukla and aloke upadhyaya are excellent. the lines are written with equivalent flamboyance and will be greeted with claps and whistles. mahesh limayes cinematography is topnotch and he makes every frame appear largerthanlife. but dabangg 3 is not without its share of flaws. the film stands on a thin storyline and the viewer can guess whats in store next. besides, the film couldve done without a song or two, thereby keeping its length in check editor ritesh soni. however, these are minor aberrations. for, the plusses easily outweigh and outnumber the minuses here. the principal cast provides the muchneeded sheen to prabhudhevas vision. salman khan uses his fists, spews venom and threats, bullies the villain, flirts and romances, does the pelvic thrusts... in fact, he does everything that one expects from chulbul pandey. honestly speaking, dabangg 3 is a salman khan vehicle and the actor is the big boss here. you cannot imagine anyone else doing what he does. and every time he plays to the gallery, many in the audience especially at single screens are sure to fling the loose change on screen as a mark of appreciation for his onscreen antics. he defies logic and gets away with it! he is like a ferocious lion who roars with all his might. the show belongs to the actor, who scorches the screen every time he displays the manic anger. from a statutory warning against cigarette and gutka, mouthed by khan, to his antidowry stance and a message on water conservation and a dig at demonetization at the very end, there is also ample messaging to be found in the movie. sonakshi sinhas pairing with salman looks wonderful. she is her usual chirpy and feisty self as rajjo. she delivers the right expressions. the newcomer saiee manjrekar has an infectious charm and radiates confidence all through the enterprise. the character she portrays has tremendous mass appeal. also, the desi girl image suits her impeccably. she is camerafriendly and confident to the t. arbaaz khan is okay. dimple kapadia is truly wonderful. pramod khanna brother of late vinod khanna is excellent. kichcha sudeep has a good screen presence. he is superb as the antagonist. hes venomous to the hilt! yet another sterling act that doesnt miss a beat! he takes giant strides as an actor gives the film the muchneeded support. on the whole, dabangg 3 is the emblematic formula movie with distinct essentials that indian masses yearn for. the film is for those who seek unabashed entertainment and relish masala films. damn the indomitable critics, pseudointellectuals and connoisseurs of parallel cinema, this ones not for them. dabangg 3 is for the aam junta. entertainment guaranteed. dabangg 3 is your ticket this festive season. dhamaal entertainer!",negative

"just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear they escaped. toy story is the kind of childrens movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. that may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. if andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a tvnintendo, and not much else. the voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. tom hanks was the biggest star of the moment when toy story came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as woody the cowboy doll. don rickles has the screen role of his career not that kellys heroes was oscar material as a prickly mr. potato head, while jim varney and r. lee ermey are standouts in the supporting cast. tim allen gives the movies best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes woodys place in andys heart but cant bring himself to accept that hes just a plastic plaything. its the role of the story that gives him the best lines i dont believe that man has ever been to medical school, but allen delivers them with real panache. he more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that noteperfect william shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated galaxy quest. while this movies use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest pixarated treatment of a story. a bugs life seems a more worthy apex that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. but given how novel all of this was in 1995, toy story could have been a lot less thoughtthrough than it was, and still made gobs of money. the fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it. i like randy newmans music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with scud the dog but also with the babys drool, where it falls short. the story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to sids bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. so too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of the claw. if it reached for pathos a little less often, toy story would be an undeniable classic. as it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film thats only good for children, even especially? the inner ones.",positive

"i wasnt angry about the fog remake until i heard that it was going to be released by revolution studios, a company known to house crap movies. from then on, my hopes werent that high, and they sank even lower when i saw the trailer. it looked to much like boogeyman or darkenss falls rather than an atmospheric, imaginative, horror production like the original. the original fog deserves to be a cult classic and is a great film, but i thought it could have used a couple of improvements. it was not john carpenters best effort, but it still was an 8 out of 10 movie. this remake had potential because it could have corrected some of the plot holes from the original. not surprisingly, the modernized fog created new loopholes in the story and in addition had a terrible script. the characters here were clichd. the naive young girl who sees horrible things happening and who is befriended by her hot exboyfriend. there is even a token black guy who serves as the comic relief for the film. why cant they have black heroes in horror movies? every character is seen in some state of undress, including stevie wayne, a mother of a young teenage boy named andy, who struts around in panties in front of her son i thought that was funny. im surprised andys old nanny wasnt shown strutting around in her undies while cleaning the dishes. the leper colony ghosts were not scary. they were all see through, and instead of a giant fishing hook, father blake carried a cane wtf??, not for support while walking, but for a scene near the end of the film where flying glass shards contribute to the death of a character. also, the fog in this film is all cgi, and is not nearly as menacing as the one in the original was.father malones character in the original was a major contributor to the story, because he represented the sins of the founding fathers. in this one, hes just a stupid old drunk who has a minimal impact on the story and plays more like the typical old lady who can see the future kind of character. also, why aim for a pg13? its obvious the filmmakers wanted to put some gore in this, and they did, because there were many deaths that involved people being maimed andor set on fire, not necessarily in that order. only a few more drops of blood and it would be r. there are two good things though. there is one pretty shocking death scene that was cool and there were some cool cinematography shots. the eerie image of the sailors on their ship in the fog gave me the chills. there was also a really creepy ghost who was only shown in shadows you never saw his face and who wore a top hat. it would have been interesting if they showed that ghost more, but alas, they shied away from it. and dont get me started on the ending. its supposed to be a shocker, but its extremely predictable. it also makes everything that preceded it make little sense. what was the point of that? stevie waynes cheesy closing monologue was even cheesier than the concluding monologue in house of the dead. overall, this dreadful remake ran shy of where it could have won the race.",negative

"scripted shows that employ a documentary format often use the p.o.v. talkinghead shot as a gimmick to put more visual variety into the show, and to create a style of storytelling that they hope will keep your attention without having to improve the plot or characterizations. you can tell because they often go back to the interview at the most weaklywritten moments. this is one problem, but not the major one, with modern family. the aspects that disturb me the most are these theyre supposed to be modern families and there are no working mothers do the writers misunderstand the term postfeminist era? except for a few temporary jobs in single eps. also there are no poor or even lowermiddleclass characters. actually, i do remember one character who was poor, but of course he was a onetime character on a christmas episode. im sick of the characters whining about firstworld problems like not being able to buy the perfect gift for their spouse on their birthday. whats so tragic about buying the ipad the day before or after their birthday? i realize this is a satire, but the writers dont seem to have that much contempt for the people theyre satirizing. they dont seem to be trying to show how spoiled and selfcentered many uppermiddleclass are it just comes out that way. thats not part of the satire, except maybe with the character of haley sarah hyland. another thing that bothers me is that claire julie bowen comes off as a lot crazier than the writers seem to intend. shes always breathlessly freaking out, and its more irritating than funny. in real life shes be at least an outpatient in some psychiatric facility. the gay couple eric stonestreet and jesse tyler ferguson are gay stereotypes, especially cameron, but since i hate political correctness and theyre actually funny it doesnt bother me much. it would be nice, however, if the show did what it could to improve americas perception of gay people. since camoron is a prissy, whining, crying drama queen, the other character, mitchell, could be the antithesis of a gay stereotype. the comedy could come from people thinking the character is straight. mannys rico rodriguezs character doesnt resemble any human being on the planet. hes too cartoonish sitcoms have always had kids who act like adults and adults who act like kids and neither funny nor wellacted. on the positive side, ed oneill is amazing as jay pritchett. as he was in married, with children, hes like a comedy machine, delivering every line perfectly. to sum up, modern family is funny and entertaining but not particularly witty and intelligent, and uses a kind of softedged, sentimental satire that flatters, but doesnt challenge, the audiences ability to laugh at itself.",positive

"i had high expectations based on the positive reviews but was quite disappointed. the story had a good potential to explore a relationship between a sophisticated black pianist who employs a white working class driver as they travel through the us south in the sixties. they have seemingly nothing in common, from the way they were brought up, the way they speak and eat, their family backgrounds and financial situations, their way of treating other people. as they spend time together on the road trip, they start to appreciate each other and learn from each other. what bothered me was that the characters ended up being caricatures instead of being believable. the film tries to depict their differences to the point that it did not make sense. for example, we are supposed to believe that a black musical genius pianist never heard of aretha franklin or little richard? or that he never tried fried chicken? i also thought that viggo mortensen was slightly overacting.... the racial problems were not depicted in an authentic way. the movie just received an oscar nomination for best picture, likely because of the social commentary and not because of great filmmaking.",negative

"first off id like to state that havent seen this film since 1990 on hbo. but even the trailers warned of doom. when the trailer isnt narrated by don lafontaine but by ronald mcdonald not kidding you know this film isnt even trying to be taken seriously! mac and me was obviously trying to exploit the phenomenal success of e.t. which remained playing in theaters for over 3 years into 1984! but it was only available on vhs in bootleg format until 1989. hence, in 1988 there was a void that needed to be filled. america was e.t.less until mac and me. well first off this film isnt nearly as bad as everyone says. its just rightfully one of the most hated films of all time because its such an obvious rip off of e.t.!!! right down to scene by scene! not kidding, some scenes are identical to e.t. like the g men chasing the school kids. its pointless to describe the plot because its exactly like e.t.!!! i cant stress this enough! from how the boy meets the alien to how the single mom finds out her sons have been hiding it, its exactly like e.t. except not good. but not really that bad. imagine if the lifetime network was given the screenplay for e.t. rather than steven spielberg. the cartoonish action violence is also way over done. sure e.t. himself took some tom jerry style blows but here poor mac gets the full ren stimpy treatment. getting sucked through vacuum cleaners more than once and getting bounced off car windshields. if all this is supposed to be comical, its not. poor mac is like the wiley coyote of cute aliens. the only other difference is that this time elliot is in a wheelchair. this way mcdonalds which produced the film can boast about how the ronald mcdonald house helps the families of crippled kids. in conclusion i can think of no reason to watch this film other than the fact that e.t.s blue ray release has been totally bastardized by new shoddy cgi fx and reedited to be more friendly. such as removing the g mens hand guns and changing some dialogue. why? e.t. was perfect! just leave it the fxxx alone! once again the clear solution to this problem is to simply watch a bootleg vhs of e.t.",negative
"while many agree this film is a comedy classic, few may realize it is also a mythological and historical classic. one of the things i love about the pythons is the many levels on which their comedy works. as a child i loved the slapstick of the monks whacking themselves in the head with boards or is it bibles?, the black knight refusing to give way at the bridge when challenged, the funny weird people digging in the mud. as an adult i then marvelled at the intelligent and hilarious satire of religious and political subjects of which i had no inkling when i first fell in love with this film the monks are penitents, and no crazier that many of their truehistory contemporaries. the black knight is a psychopathic serial killer. the mud people are fir bolg members of an anarchist commune or is it socialist? anarchosyndicalist? and the knights are riding along hadrians wall. even later in life now, as a celtic scholar, im again impressed by their knowledge of myth and history, and by how well they not only satirize, but further illuminate, the matter of britain. this film should be required viewing for all classes in celtic studies, world mythology, marxist thought in the 20th century, folklore, the applied sciences, astronomy, folk dancing, fencing, witch hunting, archery, shrubbery, moose hunting, religious history and anarchosyndicalist communes.",positive

"the adam sandlerproduced nick swardson vehicle bucky larson born to be a star is arguably one of the most deadonarrival comedies of the past decade. the film is an attempt to make a fun, quirky, raunchy comedy based on the idea of a clueless, semiugly niceguy who gets pulled into the world of the adult film industry, but the material is all too basic, and it doesnt take advantage at all of the situation. jokes are all phonedin and are the sort 13yearold boys snicker at to each other, and the writing is downright offensively bad. nick swardson plays bucky larson, a simpleton with an outlandish set of buckteeth. upon discovering that his parents were famous pornstars in the 70s, he sets off to travel to hollywood and break into the family business, intent on becoming a star. along the way, he meets a failing director don johnson, an adorable waitress christina ricci and an antagonistic male porn star. stephen dorff the film is a definite mess. the writing is very basic. with the most basic sexual jokes about size, stamina, etc imaginable and the few attempts at raunchy, grossout humor are poorly conveyed and equally basic and unfunny. and characters are alternating gratingly boring, or breathtakingly overthetop. although some of the performances give a few characters a likable edge. particularly ricci as kathy, an absolutely gorgeous waitress bucky falls for. swardson is also not bad for the role, and despite the absolute mess, bucky is wellplayed. in addition, his constantlyaggressive roommate is an absolute blast, yelling at bucky for absolutely everything. everything in this film is subpar. as i said, the writing is far too basic and uninspired. the director is also bland and boring, supporting roles are underdeveloped. there are almost no laughs in the film, and the conflicts of the characters are completely and utterly unrelatable, and therefore not funny or sensical by any stretch. this is just an example of a film where everything is fundamentally underwhelming and basic to the point where its tedious to watch. you may notice this review is pretty anemic, and thats because i simply have not been able to finish the film. ive only watched about 45 minutes of it, in pieces, fastforwarding through the rest because its such a flawed piece of work that i couldnt bring myself to watch the whole thing. im giving this an extremely generous 2 out of 10, mainly for ricci adorableness and a few funny sidecharacters. but seriously, take it from me i tried to give it a chance, and im kicking myself for watching it. avoid this mess.",negative

"what to say? me and my brother 18 and his friend also 18 went to the cinema and decided on spy kids 4d most based on our previous liking original 3 movies and the fact that 4d could only be interesting in cinema, not video. and so i expected a decent and fun childrens flick, with warm message and lot of fun action. so, i was ready to love this movie in a childrens kind of way and to see the spy kids legacy was supposed to be fun. but, when i saw the movie, i was totally disappointed. it was awful. the real value of this pic is exactly that three stars that average ratings gave, but i gave it more due to my admiration for rodriguez, alexa vega and daryl sabara. and seeing them all grown up and looking so cool and attractive was the best part of the movie, although their characters didnt do squat this time. they were kinda just... there, even more than banderas and gugino were before. but it was nice seeing them anyway. although, for alexa and daryl fans out there, if you really wanna see them now in something worthy, go see halloween, repo or machete. i know that the story is supposed to be bubbly and childish, but i think that they were totally out of proportion with plotholes and defying gravity and common sense, for anyone older than 7. and there are many childrens movies who are still innocent and fun, but far more realistic anyway. i didnt expect much realism anyway, but 30 of realism couldnt harm even the most imaginative films in the world. the talking dogrobot, shiny colors, gadgets who look more like macdonalds toys than anything else i suppose their replicas are supposed to be in promotion, all is ok by me. but, i draw the line at villains who never punch or try punching anyone, not even adult characters! they just stand there and wait to get hit!! also, performances were ok, adequate for this kind of film, no ones acting was above or below the ok level. jeremy piven was actually really fun as the main villain gosh, i spoiled the unpredictable plot twist! and his image was kinda cool. and i usually like kids, and im ready to defend them any day, but the little girl was so annoying!!! if she was an adult she would be called a name starting on b, no doubt. and the way she treated jessica! i never thought i would say that, but she needed to get hers, and not her brother instead, who was kinda cute. effects were decent, but 4d was awful! at least in my cinema. nothing was going out. numbers couldnt be scratched out, just on them, and all smells were kinda similar, mostly like peppermint. and yeah... spy detector... right! but i guess it is ok if you are 7.",negative
"any spoof with strong production values deserves some credit for effort and meet the spartans gets high marks for set designs and costumes. actors perform their material well. there are a number of funny bits in this film, but it falls short of ranking as a great spoof. the primary reason is it strayed too frequently from the genre represented by 300. think of a great spoof, like airplane. it had great bits taken from the airport series of films as well as the classic from the 50s, the high and the mighty. meet the spartans might have turned out better if they had stuck to 300 and films like alexander, troy, and others of the genre. instead, they branched out in all directions including tv shows and personalities. in the final analysis, they only had enough good material for a skit on saturday night live. the rest was filler. not a total waste of time as implied by the 55 voting 1 but not great either.",negative
"this movie had simply nothing to do with christmas. the whole point of the movie was to preach... nothing more. the acting was just that... acting... no sincerity at all. the point of the movie was to attempt to convince folks the true meaning of christmas without showing sincerity what so ever. the actors were just simply not believable. it simply showed how unconvinced they were about their message. they were reading a script of the message they had to send. no true emotion was shown in the delivery of their message, making them seem like frauds.",positive
"this anime is the most unique fantasy anime ive watched. unlike other fantasy animes which focus on the journey to defeat the demon king, the storyline of this anime focuses on what happens after the demon king was defeated. the main character, frieren, is an elf mage who can live an extraordinarily long life compared to humans travels around the world and collecting weird magic spells. since she is an elf, she cannot understand humans behaviors and emotions. as she tries to understand the past gestures of affections from the hero, himmel, who had already passed away years ago, she decided to meet the person himself for answers. thus, she starts her journey to the place called heaven. on the way, she takes fern as an apprentice and recruits stark to go together. to be honest, i was a little put off because the hero died too early, but i gave the benefits of the doubt and continued watching it and it was the best decision ever. i love how frieren looks like a cold and aloof person who cannot understand humans, but as the story goes, she started showing emotions and affectionate gestures towards her companions, fern and stark. she also begins to realize the past affections of the hero. also, she used to have no concept of time due to her long life span but as she travels with her human companions, she has to beware of how much time she takes on the journey. of course, we cant forget the hero, himmel! he is not alive anymore but the flashbacks of frieren are always about him and hes just so charming. he is righteous, kind and a great leader. he fits the role of the hero perfectly. he always care for the humans deeply and treat them with kindness. he is the prince charming! i still feel so sad that he is only included in the flashbacks and not in the journey. also! i just found out that the characters names came from german! frieren means feeling cold, which describes her cold personality. himmel is heaven in german and i love how this journey has a double meaning because frieren is going on this journey to find heaven to meet himmel and it can also means that frieren is traveling to find himmel himself! the anime itself is very relaxing to watch but it also has fight scenes. madhouse did a great job the animation. the movements of the characters are fluid and looks so natural. also,the sceneries are always colorful and dreamy that you can feel the nostalgia from those views. there arent many magic spells but the fight scenes are still clean because every move is described clearly and not just randomly thrown beams of light. the faces of the characters might look a little chubby but i like it because it makes the characters looks a little goofy and soft. i guess this is just a different art style. so, if you want to watch something to relax but also not boring, i recommend this series. believe me. once you started episode 1, you are going to be invested in this anime, emotionally and physically! this series just makes me feel so much sentiments and nostalgia. the best series ever!",positive
i dearly loved peanuts and the charlie brown specials were especially dear to me. i have several copies of vince guaraldis album and they always make me feel warm and nostalgic. a charlie brown christmas is part of my annual holiday tv watching. i even remember the dolly madison ads that originally broadcast the first few years it was shown.,positive
"ill be honest this show got me hooked from the very first episode and it kept me attached to it till the last one. if theres one thing which describes this show accurately then thats entertainment because thats what it does throughout the show. there are numerous hits and misses as well but it has always managed to get things in balance again. the whole cast has done a really decent job and makes the viewer pick their favourite one. one thing which theyve done pretty satisfactorily is that although the show has primarily swirled around the character of harvey, it didnt fail to uncover other characters personalities. in the end, the audience knows all of them pretty nicely and feels for them. the show ended on a pleasant note and ive absolutely no complaints regarding it. thankyou suits family.",positive
"wow! just wow! this is the best series that i have watched since game of thrones even though we all know how that ended. this was a masterful family drama throughout the whole show and even though at first it felt slow. when the family drama begins it definitely shines bright. succesion as a series is also a comedy which is really funny, but it never makes it so the viewer cant take it seriously. since the series is written masterfully and the actors do an outstanding job giving justice to the amazing script. truly great performances throughout. with alot of standout performances. no bad performances to be found. the ending though divisive is a great ending for the characters i have learned to care for. great television and the pinnacle of prestige tv.",positive

"the mask, starring jim carrey, was an absolute success when it was released in 1994, and i would say well deservingly. not exactly a classic in my book, but a good movie nonetheless. son of the mask, a sequel to the 1994 blockbuster, came nearly eleven years later, featuring a different set of characters and a different cast, but still the same mask. unfortunately, this didnt work out so well. unlike the 1994 original, this one flopped, even won a razzie award, and was nominated for a bunch of others! since this sequel is in the bottom 100, its generally considered atrocious, and i cant exactly say im with the majority on this one, but can still describe the film as pretty much worthless. loki, the norse night god of mischief, has been sent by his father, odin, to find lokis mask, which will not be easy, as he will find more than one replica of this mask. during his search, his real mask is found by a dog named otis, owned by an aspiring cartoonist named tim avery. otis brings the mask to his owner, so it is now in the hands of this aspiring cartoonist, though he is obviously unaware of its powers at first! after this, tim soon becomes a father, with a newborn son named alvey, who is born with the powers of loki! while tims wife, tonya, is out on a business trip, he finds that looking after alvey on his own as he tries to fulfill his ambition is very difficult as he gradually learns the extent of his sons powers! meanwhile, loki has been informed by odin that a baby has been born with his powers, and he will find the mask if he finds this baby. since the norse night god of mischief is so determined to get it, tim could be headed for even more trouble! why cant i vote 110 for this movie like the majority of others? well, i just wasnt absolutely revolted by it. my biggest problem with the movie is that it simply isnt funny. ill admit, i did smile a couple times i think that includes the part where alvey has just been influenced by tv and starts singing ragtime gal, but the gags involving the baby and his tv imitations wear thin very fast, and i definitely smiled at the part where loki slaps odin and came close to it at other times, but for the most part, i didnt even find it remotely amusing. we have some lame fart and bowel movement jokes, but an upside is that they tend to keep the grossout gags brief. another one of these gags is one where loki turns a womans head into a giant nose, and she sneezes, blowing out a ton of snot on the ground. once again, lame, but once again, they kept it brief. so, while these gags do make the film worse, they would have sunk it even more if they put more of them in andor made them longer and more graphic. now, dont get me wrong, i am not defending son of the mask, im just saying why i dont think its as bad as apparently most people who have seen it do. overall, i found the movie boring, and some of the gags put a confused look on my face, which may include some of the ones ive mentioned, as well as otis hopelessly trying to get rid of alvey while wearing the mask, which involves a lot of slapstick, but they didnt pull it off. for a long time, i have been aware of the fact that jim carrey played the starring role of stanley ipkiss in the 1994 blockbuster, but in this sequel, i didnt recognize anybody, other than kal penn i had only seen him in the dreadful epic movie, which i see has a slightly higher rating here, though i think its significantly worse, and ben stein he was in the the mask, and i also saw him in ferris buellers day off, another funny movie. after watching this mask sequel, i have learned that loki was played by alan cumming hadnt memorized his name yet, who i had seen in the short blind date episode of mr. bean and in x2, both good roles, though i didnt know it was the same actor in both of them. however, regardless of how familiar i am with the cast members, none of them are any match for jim carrey and the comic talent he showed in the mask. when tim avery played by jamie kennedy has the mask on, he is definitely similar to stanley ipkiss with it on, but one difference is that he is not funny. the cast as a whole is certainly nothing to rave about, and thats not the only problem with the movie, due to other things ive pointed out. so, while i dont hate this film with a passion, i do not recommend it, and wont say it didnt deserve its razzie!",negative
"okay, its not the greatest movie in the world. okay, it almost directly rips off the first one. okay, the plot twist at the end is more confusing and dumb than thought provoking. who cares? i sure dont! this was the first texas chainsaw i had ever seen. i loved it then and i love it now. the movie is about madness, plain old madness, and thats what it delivers. again, it borrows heavily on the original. a bit tacky to say the least, but its got a lot of its own to stand on. i found that the character of vilmer to be the best not leatherface psycho of the series. just edging out bill moseley as choptop. its popcorn horror, plain and simple. this movie scratches that part of me that also enjoys cannibal holocaust and toxic avenger. i recommend giving it a shot. you might hate it, or then again it might become one of your favorites.",negative
"i cant believe i actually succumbed to watching this movie. worst i have ever seen. i tried to be patient and stick with at least the first 30 minutes thinking it would get better, nope its the same from begging to end. the actors are not as half bad, but there are a lot of clichs throughout the whole film. the action scenes are really cheesy, i felt i was watching a power rangers episode for a second, it was that bad. the magic scenes felt like a harry potter wannabe. stay clear away from this film or any other uwe boll films as they are a complete waste of your time. this movie should definitely be on the worst of all times list, it at least deserves that much. i still cant believe that this was actually in a theater somewhere.",positive
"main man for me is kendall. coming from suits ending and pearson getting cancelled, it was difficult to find a corporate series decent enough. this one had long been on my list but never really gave it a chance, until now. and boy o boy does it deliver. i am glad i left it till now that i dont have any of those to watch, and i hope it goes the distance.",positive
